# **Installation Guide**

## **Requirements**
- ~ 87.6 GB of Space (13.6 GB of this can optionally be removed after install by deleting the contents of the downloads folder)
- A Legal Game of the Year Copy of Morrowind on CD Rom, Steam, Or GOG (These are the only platforms we know are functional and working, other platforms may work but we do not guarantee this)


### 1.) Install a fresh, legal copy of Morrowind Game of the Year Edition

- If you have a previous copy of this or a copy of OpenMW with preset .INI files, you will need to delete or backup these folders/files. The ini's can be found in User/Documents/My Games/OpenMW or /Morrowind. Your OpenMW folder will be where you installed it last, and your Morrowind game folder will be in your Steamapps directory.

### 2.) After it has installed, launch the game and let it generate new INI's. Once it has, press play. After reaching the main menu, exit the game.

### 4A.) (Wabbajack Gallery Users) After this has finished downloading, leave it be. Search for Path of the Incarnate on Wabbajack. Make sure you have checked "Unofficial Lists". Open the list and set the correct modlist path that you wish Path of the Incarnate to install to.

### 4B) (Nexus File Users) Search for Path of the Incarnate on Nexus and download the zip folder containing the .wabba file. Unzip this folder and place the Wabbajack file somehwere you can easily select it. Now open Wabbajack, select install from disk, and select the .wabba file. Then set the correct modlist path that you wish Path of the Incarnate to install to.

- Once you select your Modlist installation, Wabbajack will automatically assign a downloads folder within it for you.

- Make sure your chosen path is NOT on a protected path such as program files, desktop, etc. It is best to create it on the base of a drive (IE: C:/POTI). After doing this, click the play button at the right and wait for the list to fully download

### 5.) Once the installation has completed, you can click the checkmark to close Wabbajack. Now we will continue with getting OpenMW setup.

### 6.) Find the OpenMW zip file that you downloaded earlier and unzip it in a location of your choice.

- It is suggested that you unzip it in or near your POTI install folder for ease of access.

- You may also rename this to whatever you would like

- If you do place your OpenMW folder inside of your POTI directory, remember that it will delete each time you update the list. It is suggested that you remove it from the folder and place it in a location such as your desktop before updating to avoid having to reinstall.

### 13.) (OPTIONAL) Go to the Data Files section in the OpenMW menu that opens up, then Navigation Mesh Cache below. Press the "Update" button to begin this process

- This step has been shown to significantly decrease load times in game, but will take some time and is entirely optional.

- You may increase the Max Size of the Nav Mesh Cache, but please only do so if you know what you are doing. Otherwise, stick with the default. The largest we have heard of is 18 gb.
