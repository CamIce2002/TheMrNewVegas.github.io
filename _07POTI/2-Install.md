# **Installation Guide**
## **Please Follow These Steps Verbatim: Otherwise Your Installation May Not Work As Intended**

### **1.) Install a fresh, legal copy of Morrowind Game of the Year Edition on Steam**

- **If you have a previous copy of this or a copy of OpenMW with preset .INI files, you will need to delete or backup these folders/files. The ini's can be found in User/Documents/My Games/OpenMW or /Morrowind. Your OpenMW folder will be where you installed it last, and your Morrowind game folder will be in your Steamapps directory.**

### **2.) After it has installed, launch the game and let it generate new INI's. Once it has, press play. After reaching the main menu, exit the game.**

### **4.) After this has finished downloading, leave it be. Search for Path of the Incarnate on Wabbajack. Make sure you have checked "Unofficial Lists". Open the list and set the correct paths that you wish Path of the Incarnate to install to.** 

**- Make sure it is NOT on a protected path such as program files, desktop, etc. It is best to download it to the base of a drive (IE: C:/POTI). After doing this, click the play button at the right and wait for the list to fully download**
