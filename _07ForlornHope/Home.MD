# **Welcome to the Wiki for Forlorn Hope**
## **A Fallout 4 Survival Roleplaying Experience**


Forlorn Hope is an upcoming Fallout 4 Modlist which attempts to tie in elements of popular titles such as STALKER, Days Gone, our Capital Punishment list, and other survival games to bring a unique and challenging experience to The Commonwealth. 

```
To My Dearest Ellen, 

We're in a tough spot here and none of the men expect to make it out alive.
Things look pretty grim. I'm writing this so that if anything happens to me,
you know how much you meant to me.



I was foolish to join the NCR and leave you behind and I've regretted it every
second of every day that I've been here. My only wish now is to see you again
and hold you in my arms. The only thing that keeps me going are my thoughts of
you.

Just know that I made mistakes, but you were the best thing that ever happened
to me. I'm sorry, and I love you.

Harry```
