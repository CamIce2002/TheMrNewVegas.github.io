## **A Fallout 4 Survival Roleplaying Experience**

Forlorn Hope is an upcoming Fallout 4 Modlist which attempts to tie in elements of popular titles such as STALKER, Days Gone, our Capital Punishment list, and other survival games to bring a unique and challenging experience to The Commonwealth. Ammo, guns and armors matter. Where your shots and the enemies go can be the difference between life and death. Each venture from a city should be prepared for in advance; Ammo, food, water, and other supplies properly stocked up on. But with persistence comes progression and with progression, an easier experience in the reacherous experience we have tried to create.

Forlorn Hope was named after the popular camp in Fallout New Vegas. We wanted to show that we have not forgotten our roots from Capital Punishment, and will provide plenty of references to the days of the Capital/Mojave.
