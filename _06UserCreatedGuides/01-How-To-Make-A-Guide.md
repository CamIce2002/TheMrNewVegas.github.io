## **How to Submit a Wiki Page**

{: .note}
> It is generally advised that the user know basic markdown and github functionality before submitting a page. This guide will cover some of this but not everything

1.) In our [Github](https://github.com/TheMrNewVegas/TheMrNewVegas.github.io) find the section labeled User Created Guides

{: .hint}
> This entire process can be done locally using a text document. Simply replace the .txt with .md and upload the finished document into the Created Guides section as a Pull Request

2.) Click add file at the top right of the page. Name your file '#-Name.md'.

{: .note }
> The # symbol stands for the number that your post is. This is how we organize posts. Make sure to number your post to be after the last one (IE: If the last file is called 08-Guide.md, your folder should be called 09-Name.md)

{: .note }
> A hyphen should go between all spaces of your file's name (Ex: 01 The Mr New Vegas.md would be 01-The-Mr-New-Vegas.md)

3.) Inside of your newly created file, add this code block and properly fill in the necessary areas

```---
layout: default
title: Your Page's Name that will be displayed on the website
nav_order: Your pages # without 0 at the beginning 
description: Short description of your page
---```

4.) The beginning of creating your page is now complete, now format it as you please with all of the information you would like. A formatting guide can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

5.) Once you finish, press Propose New File at the bottom

6.) On the new page, look for the button "Create Pull Request"

7.) Write a short descriptive title, a summary about what your page is adding, and make sure to check `Allow Edits by Maintainers`. Then click "Create Pull Request"

8.) Your page is now officially submitted and will be reviewed in time. Page acceptance/denial is up to staff discrepancy
