# HOS 0.9.1 Release

## Save Safe?: YES (Although using a save from an interior is advised)

[Release Notes](https://discord.com/channels/415287319982112768/610934257182965779/1179222049869279293)

This is mainly a hotfix for some of the bugs that have been encountered so far, although the weather has been changed from NAT 2018 to NAT 3 and several optional ENBs are now available to choose from (with a new section on the install guide) and some QOL mods have been added in from suggestions. If updating from an existing save, some funkiness from weather is possible so it's recommended before updating to first get to an interior location and save. Smart Training will also have to be activated but can only be activated on a save where training has not been performed at that level. The MCM recorder has also been updated to account for this so new saves won't have to worry about that, and time flies has been toned down.
