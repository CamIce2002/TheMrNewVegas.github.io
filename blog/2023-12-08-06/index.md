Fixed quite a few things that have been reported over the last few days, bring the list back to a more playable state than it has been post 1540. There may be some lingering issues or bugs that I have not fixed, but a majority of these are those that have been there for a while and are planned to be worked on for 1.5.5.0. If any bugs reoccur, please let us know in #ttw-bug-report and thank you guys for your patience!
