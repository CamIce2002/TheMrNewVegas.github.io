# Capital Punishment 1.5.5.0 Release
## **Save Safe?:** NO
[Release Notes](https://www.modlists.net/docs/2capitalpunishment/Release-Notes)

Capital Punishment's 1.5.5.0 release is upon us and has released with a few bug fixes, reworked LODs, and quite a few other changes. If you are curious, you may (as always) check the link above regarding what exactly has changed. Currently, one thing I will note in this announcement is the delay of BSA packaging our resources and completely solving performance issues. BSA packing, as you guys have seen, has been causing a lot of issues with LOD's looking funky. While I work on solving why this is happening, we will be sticking to loose files for our large scale texture packs/LOD's which will have some performance hit compared to packed BSAs. On the topic of performance, while I have made some much needed adjustments and removals which positively benefited performance (on my end), performance has always and will be an uphill battle for the foreseeable future. Please read the sections I have below in regards to all of this

## My game is running pretty slow, what can I do to increase frames?

- Make no mistake, who doesn't wan't to run a modlist with all the bells and whistles? That being said, the high profile is not designed for every single machine out there. If you are experiencing lag, try first switching to a lower profile.
- If switching profiles only provides minimally positive results, try installing [NVHR](https://www.modlists.net/docs/2capitalpunishment/InstallGuide/Performance-Tweaks#downgrade-to-nvhr-32). THIS CAN BE DONE AT ANY POINT IN YOUR PLAYTHROUGH
- If none of these work for you or your issues still persist, then refer to [Wall's Performance Guide](https://performance.moddinglinked.com/falloutnv.html)
