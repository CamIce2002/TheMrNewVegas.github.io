## [Release Notes](https://www.modlists.net/docs/2capitalpunishment/Release-Notes#release-1546---12042023)

## Save Safe?: YES (1545+)

This update further fixes LOD's and adds back NVAC, the long winded message left with 1545 was one I should have waited to send before I was sure there were no issues so my apologies. The focus of 1.5.5.0 will be to see if NVAC will be a permanent dependency or one we can get rid of. Thank you to everyone for being so patient with us as we release numerous hotfixes and updates and we appreciate the continued support as always.

If you continue to experience the same crashes with this hotfix, please let us know in #"Crashing on Launch Megathread - 1.5.4.6"
