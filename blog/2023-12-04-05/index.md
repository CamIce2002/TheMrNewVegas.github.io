## **[Release Notes](https://www.modlists.net/docs/2capitalpunishment/Release-Notes#release-1545---unreleased)**
## **Save Safe?: NO**

This update fixes a few minor bugs I found throughout the last release that were brought to my attention/that I found whilst testing while also adding in the very anticipated (by the staff at least) addition - Radiant Questing! If you're curious about how this works, check it our yourself in game :).

**Removing NVAC; A  (Not So) Small Ending Message**

I have been very hesitant to remove New Vegas Anti Crash for the last 6 months. While I know that any good list should not have it installed, it has been a long time crutch (or so we thought) for Capital Punishment considering the sheer amount we have added, let alone some mods we know that cause issues we are unable to fix. 

Recent testing with it disabled using the latest release of NVHR has posed positive results on my end, making me fairly confident that the list can and has been able to be independent of NVAC for a while. 

Of course, if you notice a large amount of crashes occur, especially those which are reproduceable, use #ttw-bug-report and let us know. It will be there optionally for those who would like the comfort of having it enabled like I have all of these months. 

For the time being, I have disabled NVAC, but have left it under our new Optional Installations & Performance tab. If you have any performance issues going forward, please utilize our wiki that we have taken the time to write. Many users have been able to install NVHR, DXVK, and other resources mentioned here with positive results.
