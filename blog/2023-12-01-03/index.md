# Capital Punishment 1.5.40 Update

## Save Safe?: No

## [Release Notes](https://www.modlists.net/docs/2capitalpunishment/Release-Notes#release-1540---12012023)

This update updates a couple of mods, fixes some bug/crash issues, but most importantly packs all of our large worldspace edits into BSA files. This is to ensure the best possible performance on all systems, and should both increase performance and decrease load times.
