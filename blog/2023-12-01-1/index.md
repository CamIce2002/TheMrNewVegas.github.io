### **[Release Notes](https://www.modlists.net/docs/2capitalpunishment/Release-Notes#release-1533---11312023)**

This release only makes it so that 4 GB Patcher patches your game on its own, effectively removing an unneeded install step. This is not a required download for users who have already downloaded 1532 and followed the added step, but is a useful update for those who have not updated/installed yet.
