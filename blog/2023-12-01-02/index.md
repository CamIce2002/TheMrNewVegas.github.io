# **December Update - Supporter Contest Winners & What We Have Going On

## **Contest Winner & Next Contest**

This contest was sponsored by @sexythighs so a huge shoutout to him for providing **Baldur's Gate 1 & 2**. The winner has been chosen, and it issssss.......

Discord User de_generate!!!! 

This month's giveaway will be for **Lethal Company**! 

## **Forlorn Hope - Some Sad News**

After much deliberation between @mctiddies4lunch and myself, we have decided to cancel Forlorn Hope. This isn't a decision we made lightly as we put a lot of time into building it, but realized it did not really pique our interest anymore. This doesn't mean we will change our minds and create an entirely new Fallout 4 list, but for the time being we have decided against moving forward with Forlorn Hope itself. Thank you to everyone who has eagerly awaited its release and know that while we may not be releasing this list, we are actively working on our current ones/have others that we plan to bring to you guys in the future

## **Capital Punishment & Nostalgia**

As you guys have seen, the updates have been pretty abundant for these two lists as of recent. We apologize for the constant updating and announcements, but know it comes from a good place to want to make these lists the best they can be. We'll still be doing these large scale kinds of updates, but likely slowing update consistency down a bit so that you guys aren't always scrambling to get the newest version,

## **Halls of Sovngarde, Path of the Incarnate, & Ordo Hereticus**

These three lists are actively being worked on and updated by their respective authors and we really hope you are enjoying them. We appreciate your continued feedback on these lists and would love for that to continue as they are updated!

## **Staff Hiring**

We are also now hiring new @Helper and @Developer and you can apply [here](https://dyno.gg/form/a64b9852) if you are interested!
