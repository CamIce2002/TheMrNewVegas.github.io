            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="new-subreddit"><strong>New Subreddit</strong><a href="https://www.modlists.net/blog/cap1530#new-subreddit" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to new-subreddit" title="Direct link to new-subreddit">​</a></h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boneyardcreations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Link</a></strong></p>
<p>We have decided to spread out even further in the realms of social media and open up a subreddit! This will be another place where we will be posting our updates and interacting with you fine folks, but also a place where you can share your screenshots, clips, make help posts, and much more! While the rudimentary functionality and design is in place, there are still some nitpicks to go. Regardless, we hope this new platform is well received and would love to see you guys on it when you have the chance</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="capital-punishment-update-release---1530"><strong>Capital Punishment Update Release - 1.5.3.0</strong><a href="https://www.modlists.net/blog/cap1530#capital-punishment-update-release---1530" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to capital-punishment-update-release---1530" title="Direct link to capital-punishment-update-release---1530">​</a></h2>

<strong>Save Safe?:</strong> NO</p>
<p>This next update is probably the largest update since the release of 1.5 itself (possibly even rivaling 1.5 in terms of scale). Primarily, this update has focused on visuals but also adds quite a big change we did not think we'd be able to implement</p>
<p><strong>THE STOCK GAME FOLDER IS DEAD</strong></p>
<p>With rootbuilder, you now can rely on your own installation of Fallout: New Vegas to play <strong>without</strong> modifying your base install! This also allows for potential use of other Fallout: New Vegas copies to install Capital Punishment (Ex: GOG).</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>This is mainly a hotfix for some of the bugs that have been encountered so far, although the weather has been changed from NAT 2018 to NAT 3 and several optional ENBs are now available to choose from (with a new section on the install guide) and some QOL mods have been added in from suggestions. If updating from an existing save, some funkiness from weather is possible so it's recommended before updating to first get to an interior location and save. Smart Training will also have to be activated but can only be activated on a save where training has not been performed at that level. The MCM recorder has also been updated to account for this so new saves won't have to worry about that, and time flies has been toned down.</p>]]></content:encoded>
