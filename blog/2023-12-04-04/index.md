## **Save Safe?: NO**

This update fixes a few minor bugs I found throughout the last release that were brought to my attention/that I found whilst testing while also adding in the very anticipated (by the staff at least) addition - Radiant Questing! If you're curious about how this works, check it our yourself in game :).
