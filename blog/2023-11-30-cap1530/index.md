## **New Subreddit**
**[Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/boneyardcreations)**

We have decided to spread out even further in the realms of social media and open up a subreddit! This will be another place where we will be posting our updates and interacting with you fine folks, but also a place where you can share your screenshots, clips, make help posts, and much more! While the rudimentary functionality and design is in place, there are still some nitpicks to go. Regardless, we hope this new platform is well received and would love to see you guys on it when you have the chance :slight_smile:

## **Capital Punishment Update Release - 1.5.3.0**
**[Release Notes](https://www.modlists.net/docs/2capitalpunishment/Release-Notes)**
**Save Safe?:** NO

This next update is probably the largest update since the release of 1.5 itself (possibly even rivaling 1.5 in terms of scale). Primarily, this update has focused on visuals but also adds quite a big change we did not think we'd be able to implement

With rootbuilder, you now can rely on your own installation of Fallout: New Vegas to play **without** modifying your base install! This also allows for potential use of other Fallout: New Vegas copies to install Capital Punishment (Ex: GOG).
