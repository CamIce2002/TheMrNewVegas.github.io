<p>After much deliberation between @mctiddies4lunch and myself, we have decided to cancel Forlorn Hope. This isn't a decision we made lightly as we put a lot of time into building it, but realized it did not really pique our interest anymore. This doesn't mean we will change our minds and create an entirely new Fallout 4 list, but for the time being we have decided against moving forward with Forlorn Hope itself. Thank you to everyone who has eagerly awaited its release and know that while we may not be releasing this list, we are actively working on our current ones/have others that we plan to bring to you guys in the future</p>

<p>As you guys have seen, the updates have been pretty abundant for these two lists as of recent. We apologize for the constant updating and announcements, but know it comes from a good place to want to make these lists the best they can be. We'll still be doing these large scale kinds of updates, but likely slowing update consistency down a bit so that you guys aren't always scrambling to get the newest version,</p>

<p>These three lists are actively being worked on and updated by their respective authors and we really hope you are enjoying them. We appreciate your continued feedback on these lists and would love for that to continue as they are updated!</p>

<p>This update updates a couple of mods, fixes some bug/crash issues, but most importantly packs all of our large worldspace edits into BSA files. This is to ensure the best possible performance on all systems, and should both increase performance and decrease load times.</p>

<p>This release only makes it so that 4 GB Patcher patches your game on its own, effectively removing an unneeded install step. This is not a required download for users who have already downloaded 1532 and followed the added step, but is a useful update for those who have not updated/installed yet.</p>]]></content>

<p>We have decided to spread out even further in the realms of social media and open up a subreddit! This will be another place where we will be posting our updates and interacting with you fine folks, but also a place where you can share your screenshots, clips, make help posts, and much more! While the rudimentary functionality and design is in place, there are still some nitpicks to go. Regardless, we hope this new platform is well received and would love to see you guys on it when you have the chance</p>

<strong>Save Safe?:</strong> NO</p>
<p>This next update is probably the largest update since the release of 1.5 itself (possibly even rivaling 1.5 in terms of scale). Primarily, this update has focused on visuals but also adds quite a big change we did not think we'd be able to implement</p>
<p><strong>THE STOCK GAME FOLDER IS DEAD</strong></p>
<p>With rootbuilder, you now can rely on your own installation of Fallout: New Vegas to play <strong>without</strong> modifying your base install! This also allows for potential use of other Fallout: New Vegas copies to install Capital Punishment (Ex: GOG).</p>]]></content>

<strong>Save Safe - Yes (1.5.3.0+)</strong></p>
<p>This is a good sized hotfix, as it both updated the LOD's and fixed them. Also, some minor INI changes were made that should increase performance around the board relating to LODs.</p>]]></content>

<p>This is mainly a hotfix for some of the bugs that have been encountered so far, although the weather has been changed from NAT 2018 to NAT 3 and several optional ENBs are now available to choose from (with a new section on the install guide) and some QOL mods have been added in from suggestions. If updating from an existing save, some funkiness from weather is possible so it's recommended before updating to first get to an interior location and save. Smart Training will also have to be activated but can only be activated on a save where training has not been performed at that level. The MCM recorder has also been updated to account for this so new saves won't have to worry about that, and time flies has been toned down.</p>]]></content>
