## Welcome to the MNV Modlist Development Wiki!
This wiki was originally meant to be a wiki for only Capital Punishment, but times have changed and our managed project list is growing exponentially. Therefore you may all soon see a shift in the websites layout or the introduction of an entirely new website. This website still has a primary focus on Capital Punishment, but also has all pertinent information needed for our various In Progress & Completed lists. Below is the latest development stream and the staff who help to create these awesome experiences

## What is Capital Punishment?
Capital Punishment is Fallout New Vegas mod list based on the Tale of Two Wastelands Mod (Version 3.3.2). It seeks to bring a multitude of graphical changes and hardcore roleplaying elements to the Capital & Mojave wastes. Alongside these changes are various new quests, player homes, jobs, weapons, in game systems, and much more. If you would like to see an extensive list of our load order/mod list, [click here](https://loadorderlibrary.com/lists/capital-punishment-1122). While I can take the credit for compiling the mods together to make this list, I cannot take credit for the amazing work the many mod authors involved have provided. If you can, take the time to support and endorse mods in the list that you enjoy!

## **What is Tale of Two Wastelands?**
If you do not know what Tale of Two Wastelands is, it is a total conversion of Fallout 3 into the engine of Fallout New Vegas (with added fixes and modifications from the authors). This allows for the player to play Fallout 3 & Fallout New Vegas in the same game! For more info visit the [Tale of Two Wastelands Website](https://thebestoftimes.github.io/index.html)

## How do I Get Help?
1.) Make sure to look at the installation guide and follow in order.

2.) The next step would be to check our [FAQ](https://www.capitalpunishmentmod.com/01Support/FAQ/FAQ/)

3.) If your issue is not in the FAQ or Installation Guide, take the time to look around the Wiki (Especially if its gameplay related questions such as "How do I Repair Guns?"

4.) If your question is unanswered in our documentation, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/43EhRjU). Some fixes that we have included there are not integrated to the wiki yet. Please look through our #ttw-help, #fixes, #ttw-bug-reports, in addition to looking through pins, announcements, and using the search function

5.) If after your searches you still cannot find your issue, make a help post in #ttw-help on our discord and we will get to it as soon as possible!

## DO NOT ASK THE TALE OF TWO WASTELANDS OR OTHER DISCORDS FOR HELP

Tale of Two Wastelands does not endorse this mod list and in addition, does not have the resources or time to help with problems regarding it. Please source all help to our discord alone. Even if you think that your question relates to your installation of Tale of Two Wastelands itself, please bring it into our discord.

## A Small Note

While we use the open source Just The Docs format, we have leaned heavily on the custom resources created by the talented [Wildlander Team's Wiki](http://wiki.wildlandermod.com). I will continue to try to improve from their format and change ours to not be a near replica and would like to thank them for providing the resources for me to be able learn and produce a quality product. If you are a fan of Skyrim, please check out their [Wildlander List](https://www.wildlandermod.com). It is the sole reason I got into making mod lists and I attribute nearly all of my ideas, work ethic, and general skillset to their hard work.
