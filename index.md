## Welcome to the Boneyard Creations Modlist Wiki!
This wiki encompasses the information regarding all modlists developed by members of the Boneyard Creations/MrNewVegas Staff Team as well as myself. Our original list, Capital Punishment, has received much criticism and praise, both fair and unfair. From it all, we have taken both the fair criticism and praise to heart and have improved upon our previous attempts. Over months of trial, error, and learning we have made Capital Punishment into something we are proud of and that we feel is a stable and new experience for the budding masochist. With all of this newfound knowledge, we have decided to branch into different titles, using our combined strengths to try and make the most enjoyable modified gameplay experiences possible.

This does not go without saying that none of this would be possible without the volunteers who have spent countless hours working on open source mods, readable guides/materials, and more for these games we love. The credit should always be given to them first and foremost and I hope that you all take the time to endorse a few of your favorites, leave an encouraging comment, or show them love in some other form if you install one of our lists.

### **Developer:** SexyThighs
- One of the first members of the original staff team, Thighs has been instrumental in our bug testing and problem solving departments. 

### **Developer:** Camboi
- The newest addition to our team, Cam is the main developer and maintainer for our Xedit patch which has fixed a heap of discrepancies and bugs in the mod list

### **Helpers:** Clayby & Oatasaurus Rex
- These are our bread and butter. While we try to make things work properly, these are the individuals who dedicates their free time to ensuring those with any troubleshooting/in game issues can have expedient assistance and hopefully get things resolved. In addition to this, they are also essential in both the bug & general gameplay testing departments.

## A Small Note

While we use the open source Just The Docs format, we have leaned heavily on the custom resources created by the talented [Wildlander Team's Wiki](http://wiki.wildlandermod.com). I will continue to try to improve from their format and change ours to not be a near replica and would like to thank them for providing the resources for me to be able learn and produce a quality product. If you are a fan of Skyrim, please check out their [Wildlander List](https://www.wildlandermod.com). It is the sole reason I got into making mod lists and I attribute nearly all of my ideas, work ethic, and general skillset to their hard work.
