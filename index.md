# **Welcome to the Capital Punishment Revamped & Revitalized Wiki** 

## What is Capital Punishment?
Capital Punishment is Fallout New Vegas mod list based on the Tale of Two Wastelands Mod (Version 3.3.2). It seeks to bring a multitude of graphical changes and hardcore roleplaying elements to the Capital & Mojave wastes. Alongside these changes are various new quests, player homes, jobs, weapons, in game systems, and much more. If you would like to see an extensive list of our load order/mod list, [click here](https://www.wabbajack.org/search/TTWTrueVegas/capitalpunishment). While I can take the credit for compiling the mods together to make this list, I cannot take credit for the amazing work the many mod authors involved have provided. If you can, take the time to support and endorse mods in the list that you enjoy!

## What is Tale of Two Wastelands?
If you do not know what Tale of Two Wastelands is, it is a total conversion of Fallout 3 into the engine of Fallout New Vegas (with added fixes and modifications from the authors). This allows for the player to play Fallout 3 & Fallout New Vegas in the same game! For more info visit the [Tale of Two Wastelands Website](https://thebestoftimes.github.io/index.html)

## Game Saves, Capital Punishment Updates, & How They Coincide

{: .important}
> When updating our Wabbajack list, we will always release [Patch Notes Here](https://github.com/TheMrNewVegas/TTWTrueVegas/releases). At the top of each release there will be a statement saying **Save Safe For ____ Versions** or **Not Save Safe**. 

### Save Safe

{: .hint}
>If an update is marked as save safe, your save can be continued on the newest update safely. Make sure, however, that you pay attention to the versions it is save safe for. If an update called 1.43 comes out saying **Save Safe for 1.4, 1.41, & 1.42** then you may safely continue **ONLY IF** you are on those versions. If you are on any other version, then it is to be considered not save safe.

### Not Save Safe

{: .warning}
> If an update is not save safe, this means that all previous updates are not compatible to be continued on it. You will either have to stick with your version or start a new game after updating. A multitude of issues can be caused by playing a save on an unsafe update. These can all lead to random CTD's to save corruption. Since these bugs/issues would not be present on a fresh save, we cannot offer support.
