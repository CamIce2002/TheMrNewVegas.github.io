**[Caravan Guard](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/58721)**

Title says all: this mod allows you to be a caravan guard. And if you're not into fighting... Well somebody has to clean brahmin excrements.

Basically this mod adds new caravan company located near NCR sharecropper farms, just go there and ask for a job. If you'll pass the skill check you'll become a caravan guard.

This maybe isn't a great adventure, but a repeatable job with decent payment. How much? Well. it depends... dead brahmin=smaller payment. As a more experienced guard you'll get paid well and get an unique caravan shotgun.

Caravan routes:

Grizzly Caravans -> 188 Trading Post -> Novac -> Mojave Outpost
Mojave Outpost -> Novac -> 188 Trading Post -> Grizzly Caravans

Grizzly Caravans -> Sloan -> Mojave Outpost
Mojave Outpost -> Sloan -> Grizzly Caravans

You don't have to guard the caravan whole route. You get paid on every stop and you can resign whenever you want!

**[New Vegas Bounties I LE](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/77108)**

The first installment in a series for Fallout: New Vegas. Upon initiating the quest, you'll be tasked with tracking down the most malevolent and vile assortment of outlaws in the Mojave Wasteland.

Your targets will include rogue rangers, fiends, raiders, drug smugglers, cannibals, and pistoleros, to name a few. Your opponents are all designed to be boss-caliber, akin to the fiends in "Three-Card Bounty", and become gradually more difficult as you progress.

At its core, New Vegas Bounties is an action mod; extreme violence and profanity are ubiquitous. In lieu of mind-boggling puzzles or "go collect x or y resource"-type quests, you will be confronted with dangerous opponents who are designed to frustrate and kill you. You will be harried, ambushed, outnumbered, and outgunned. This is the path of a bounty hunter - take it or leave it.

New Vegas Bounties also offers erudite conversations with your boss, Randall as well as interesting choices involving skills and perks with your adversaries.

**[Claim the Mojave](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/75196)**

A gold sink mod designed around allowing the player to spend caps to build outposts at locations in the Mojave for the faction of their choice. Designed for use alongside FPGE and TLD. Includes a TTW addon to claim locations in the Capital Wasteland.

==Starting the Mod==
The main hub for this mod is an Abandoned Army Bunker found in a narrow canyon north of Spring Mt. Ranch State Park and South of Red Rock Canyon. Once you find the key card that lets you into the bunker (or if you have a high enough science skill, bypass the security panel) and restart the bunkerâ€™s generators, you can claim the bunker for the faction of your choice. You can also rename the bunker whatever you want using a text input menu.

**[The Inheritance](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/49012)**

Having learned of the Courier's exploits, a dying man contacts the player in hopes of employing him/her to deliver a mysterious package. Upon accepting the job, the Courier will soon find himself/herself making unwilling allies and dangerous enemies, all jockeying to claim the same prize.

The Inheritance is a compact, lore-friendly quest mod for Fallout: New Vegas, designed to offer new avenues to experience combat and role-playing for high-level characters. It offers a challenging primary quest that is followed by a collection of small sidequests, all dependent on the player's actions. While all of these quests include the trademark ultra-violence and profanity found in my past mods, some of the content departs from New Vegas Bounties in tone and style, as some quests are more dependent on finesse instead of aggression. A detailed description of prerequisites for each sidequest is included in the readme. This mod began as a series of scripting experiments for another project, The Siege of Firebase Zulu, therefore some of the sidequests are wholly unrelated to the primary quest. Nonetheless, I believe players appreciate fresh content, so I elected to include these missions.

**[Beyond Boulder Dome](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/46907)**

The Boulder Dome was constructed before the war to be a "city of the future"; a prototype for future cities on the moon and other planets. It was also an advanced scientific research facility, and an Ark of sorts, built to withstand severe nuclear attacks. And withstand it did.

Mere hours before the bombs dropped, only the elite of society, or those with specialist skills; the top of their fields, were transported to the Dome and transported two hundred years into the future. Put into a "cold sleep", they would ride out the war and the following chaos, to start a new world in the future.

When the scientists woke up, they found themselves in a nightmare. Their bodies now riddled with a strange disease of unknown origin, dubbed the Seltsam Syndrome; literally meaning "strange disease". Forced to wear advanced Bio-suits, to help slow the spread, they struggle to survive, as time is running out.

Beyond the Dome, outside the highly toxic ruins of Boulder, two factions are moving in.

The NCR has a deadly and unmerciful mission, to stop the spread of the Seltsam Syndrome by eliminating all potential carriers. They have tracked the disease to its last known vestige, The Boulder Dome itself.

The Colorado branch of the Brotherhood of Steel have also set their sights on the Dome. Its leader seeks to control the Dome for the good of the region, he claims, to bring peace to the chaos. Very close to a real, working cure for the Seltsam Syndrome, he offers a seemingly peaceful solution.

Forced into the middle of things, is a simple courier, far from home. The decisions of the courier may slide the balance in many different ways, ultimately determining the fate of the scientists of The Boulder Dome.

Colorado is a place with many secrets and surprises. Three new worldspaces. New unique weapons and armor, new creatures never before seen with custom sounds, new robots. 50+ fully voiced and lip-synced characters. A long main quest with multiple pathways, and many side-quests should provide many hours of gameplay.

Boom to the Moon follows the adventures of Anaximander (you can call him "Max"), a young man who needs help finding out what has happened to his wife. There may be a rocket and spacesuits involved. Things will probably balloon from there.
