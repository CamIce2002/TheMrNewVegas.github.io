description: How is Fast Travel Handled?
---

Fast travel is in the game! But not how you think. Fast travel is one of the best, yet least immersive things about Fallout. However, now that is a thing of the past! There are several ways the player may fast travel which will be detailed below!

## **Transporters**

A faction of roaming wanderers, these people will take you from point A to point B â€“ for a few caps of course. They can be found at any and every settlement and offer 20 travel locations. Why not try them out, find their settlement, or even apply for a PREMIUM travel membership? 

## **Travelling with Caravans**

If you've got the caps, you can travel with any wandering or stationary caravan to their next stop(s). Be warned though, random events will occur when you do travel with them, all wildly varying.
