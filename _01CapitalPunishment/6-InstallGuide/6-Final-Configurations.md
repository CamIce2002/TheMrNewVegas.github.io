## **Final Configurations**
- If your game won't boot and you cannot find the the libogg.dll, libvorbis.dll, or libvorbisfile.dll in your "Capital Punishment/Stock Game" directory after having fully finished the TTW steps, you may find copies in your "Capital Punishment/Game Folder Files" directory which you can copy and paste into your "Capital Punishment/Stock Game directory"

- Now find your Tale of Two Wastelands mod in the left hand pane.

- The Fallout New Vegas launcher will popup, change your resolution & preset to what you would like. Press ok when you have finished setting your settings to your preference then exit the launcher

### **Preconfigured Save Game**

- Go to Your Capital Punishment/Game Folder Files

- Go back to the main directory, then to the profiles folder

- Go into Casual_Punishment_Default/saves and paste the files inside

- After doing this your game should run smoothly! Run Tale of Two Wastelands through MO2 again. You will likely receive a popup asking you would like to clear a read only flag. Make sure you choose **"Clear Read Only Flag"**.

- You can delete the downloads folder once the process is completed and running properly. This will save you a lot of hard drive space, but will make updating slower and have to be done each time you update

## **If You Cant Find the Provided Lib Files**

- Go to your Fallout New Vegas directory you downloaded (Not the Mod Organizer one, but your original one). Find the libogg.dll, libvorbis.dll, & libvorbisfile.dll

- Copy and paste all three of these to the "Mod Organizer>Stock Game" folder

### **NVHR Sidenote:** A black dialog box will pop up when you run your game. This mod is essential, but those who experience in game lag may be experiencing a side effect of Steam's Shader Pre-caching system interfering with NVHR and vice versa. 

- To rid of this simply open your steam, go to the top left of steam where it says "Steam", and under that menu settings.

- When the Settings Menu opens up, go to "Shader Precaching", then disable "Enable Shader Pre-Caching"

Congratulations! Your game should be up and running smoothly. You can continue to the option seventh step if you would like NVHR! 

- If you would like to free up some space, you may also delete the contents of the downloads folder. The con of doing this is that updates will take longer as it will need to install everything again when you do update
