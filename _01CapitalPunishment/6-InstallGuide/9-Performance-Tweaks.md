## **Performance Tweaks**
This is a completely optional step and mainly intended for those who are experiencing frame rate issues. I do not feel confident enough in my knowledge regarding performance to type out a guide. I also want to directly rip off the hard work of Wall on this page. Therefore below you may find a link to Wall's guide; more specifically the FPS Limiter guide.
