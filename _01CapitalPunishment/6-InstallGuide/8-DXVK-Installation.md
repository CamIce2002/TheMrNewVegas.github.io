## **What is DXVK?**

- DXVK (DirectX Vulkan) is a Vulkan-based translation layer for Direct3D 9, 10 and 11 that allows you to run 3D apps and games. We use it to run Fallout: New vegas through the DXVK API which has benefits of much lower drawcall overhead than D3D9, which is one of the main performance limiting factors in this game

> For more information on its functionality, whether your gpu supports this, and its application to New Vegas, [Wall's Guide](https://wallsogb.github.io/FalloutNV-Performance-Guide/#DXVK) is very informative

## **What Cards are Supported?**
- All RTX GPUs are supported, together with GeForce GTX 1660 with 6GB+ of memory and GeForce GTX 1060+ with 6GB+ of memory
> As previously stated, [Wall's Guide](https://wallsogb.github.io/FalloutNV-Performance-Guide/#DXVK) contains resources which will help determine if your Card is supported otherwise
