# **THIS INSTALLATION GUIDE HAS BEEN SUPERCEDED BY [THIS ONE](https://www.modlists.net/01CapitalPunishment/2-Abbreviated-Installation/). WHEN WE UPDATE TO 1.5, THESE PAGES WILL GO DOWN AND BE REPLACED BY THE ABBREVIATED INSTALLATION GUIDE. 

## **READ BEFORE CONTINUING:** 
### **1.) Please do not bother the Tale of Two Wastelands Developers/Discord or Other NV related Discords with troubleshooting questions regarding this mod list. Even if you think your question pertains to the Tale of Two Wastelands installation, please ask us in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/43EhRjU).**

### **2.) You MUST follow this guide in the order given and word for word. If you do not you will experience issues. Please read through it at least once prior to install**

### **3.) This mod pack is not a vanilla experience nor is it a stability guide. In addition we are not endorsed by the Tale of Two Wastelands team. Regardless of endorsements and the prior statements, we have kept stability, gameplay balance, and cohesiveness in mind. To ensure a basis of this, I have utilized guides such as [WSG](https://wastelandsurvivalguide.com), [VNV](https://vivanewvegas.github.io/index.html), & the [TTW Installation Guide](https://thebestoftimes.github.io/index.html)**.

## **Starting Off...**

- Install both Fallout New Vegas & Fallout 3. 

{: .important}
> Make sure old installations are completely deleted and reinstalled, especially if they have been previously modded

{: .important}
> Make sure any pre-existing ini’s are deleted  so they game can build them again post installation. These can be found in Documents > My Games > Fallout NV most commonly

{: .important}
> Make sure your Fallout New Vegas is set to the English language as other languages are not supported.

- Now Install [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable x86 & x64 Version](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170) – Install them over each other by clicking “repair” when you install the other version.

### **Final Sidenote**

- When you have finished this guide, you will have two installations of Fallout New Vegas. The one you downloaded through Steam and the one that was compiled by Wabbajack.

{: .note}
> The One Compiled by Steam will be in your typical steam directory (Commonly C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\FalloutNewVegas)

{: .note}
> The One Compiled by Wabbajack will be in the folder where wabbajack will deliver all of the files (Whatever path you choose in Wabbajack\Stock Game)

{: .warning}
> YOU WILL NOT BE EDITING YOUR ORIGINAL STEAM PATH. MO2 AND THIS MODPACK WILL WORK OFF OF THE STOCK GAME FOLDER. ANY PATHS YOU SET, EDITS YOU MAKE, ETC SHOULD BE DONE TO THE STOCK GAME FOLDER GRANTED THEY ARE IN THE INSTALLATION GUIDE**
