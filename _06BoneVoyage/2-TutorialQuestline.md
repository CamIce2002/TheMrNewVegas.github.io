# **Tutorial Questline - A Beginners Guide**

When joining any server the experience may be a bit daunting if not just generally confusing. We hope this guide will remedy any confusion!

### **Part 1: New Beginnings**

- **When you first spawn you will notice that there is a sign in front of you and an invisible block. Right click this sign and block to start our tutorial questline. This guide will cover everything in these three questlines and allow you to continue to the many other quests in the server!**

1.) **After you've right clicked this sign you will be prompted with a message that leads into our first tutorial quest. Click Yes to accept the quest and start your journey into the server!**

2.) **For the first objective, simply walk up to the Rules Board, Adventurer's Guild Board, Towny Board, & Other Useful Commands Board in Spawn. Make sure to walk within 2 blocks of the light block that is in front of each board so that it completes the task!**

3.) **After you have finished reading through these boards, look for the Spawn Exit. Go down through this Exit, then look for the NPC titled `Guild Representative`. Walk up to him and right click him to teleport to the Adventurer's Guild**

4.) **Once you have reached the adventurer's guild, take a look around! To continue to the next objective just walk to the middle of the outside of the guild. Once you have done that, you can complete the next task by typing `/spawn`**

5.) **Now that we are back at Spawn, its time to head to Jothon, the Capital of the Server! Exit spawn as you did previously and look for the sign labelled City of Jothon (East). From there walk until you reach the front entrance!**

6.) **Continue straight down the road from the last step until you reach the 'Town Guide'. He will be in the center of Town where you can talk to him and complete the first quest**

### **Part 2: Town Guide**

1.) **Talk to the Town Guide again and select "Town Guide" in the menu to Start Part 2 of the Tutorial Questline!**

2.) **After accepting, head to the Jothon Market District. It will be directly to your left when facing the Town Guard or in the North Western District. As always head for the center of the Market area to reach the objective point and make sure to read your quest log as it updates!**

3.) **Return and talk to the town guide for the next location (The Bank). This is directly behind the guide or to the East. To activate this waypoint, walk up to the green and red sign in front of the door.**

4.) **Directly from the bank, you may now find and talk to `Fisherman Pontius`. He is in the North Eastern district of the city in the Gazebo. When you are done, return to the Town Guide once again**

5. **After returning to the Town Guide, you will be tasked with Killing 1 Zombie. These can be found in the Wilderness, which can be travelled to in one of two ways**

- **Using the `/RTP` command in chat**

- **Talk to the Wilderness Guide underneath spawn**

**MAKE SURE TO DO /KIT STARTER AND EQUIP THE ITEMS YOU ARE GIVEN**

6.) **After you have killed the zombie return to the town guide by using /warp Jothon. Warps are an easy way to get around the world and various important locations! This concludes Part 2 Of the Tutorial Questline!**

### **Part 3: The Mayor's Task**

1.) **To begin the final part of the tutorial questline, talk to the Mayor. He is located in the North Eastern District outside of a small house**

2.) **Like we did previously, use RTP to travel to the wilderness. Find a cozy spot in the wilderness to claim your town, then do /town create [Your Town Name]. Place 20 Stone Bricks in your town...**
- **If you do not want to create a town you can just place the 20 stone bricks down and this will complete the questline as well.**

3.) **Talk to the Mayor of Jothon one more time to complete the questline. Congratulations on making it to the end of the tutorial quests! You will now have the first five quests ready to start. You can see available quests by typing `/quests list` and see your active quest by doing `/quests journal`**
