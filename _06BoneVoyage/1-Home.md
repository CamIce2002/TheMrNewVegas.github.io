# **Welcome to Bone Voyage**
## **IP: PLAY.MODLISTS.NET:25565**
## **[STORE](SMP.MODLISTS.NET)**

### **A Towny Adventure RPG Minecraft Server**

Bone Voyage Towny RPG is a Vanilla Minecraft 1.18 to 1.20.1 Server which promotes both the exploration and concepts of a modern Roleplaying Game whilst also adding elements of town building and the original vanilla feel of Survival Minecraft. This is an experience made by a group of developers with a background in creating new gameplay experiences and like our past projects, this is one that has been well planned, created, and will be continuously supported for the far forseeable future.

### **Some Features of Our Server**

#### **Towny & Ease of Access to Commands**

One of the primary plugins we use is towny. This allows you to build or join a town or nation, alone or with friends, and enjoy the town building experience minecraft was set to be. As many people know, Towny is chock full of different commands that players have to memorize and search for. This was something we knew would be a large hassle for our members, so we began searching for a solution. We were lucky enough to find one that came in the form of an in game menu. Gone are the days of remembering multiple commands to expand and build your towns and nations and with the simple use of the commands '/town create [name]' and '/t menu', you will be able to access all of the features of towny in a convenient manner. Of course the commands are stil an option for those more comfortable with the more analog style of features!

#### **New Structures, Dungeons, World Bosses, Guilds, Weapons, Armor, & a Plethora of Other RPG Like Changes**

Through the use of EliteMobs & Better Structures, you will now be able to find various new structures, mobs, dungeons, items, and so much more. In addition to this, quests, custom made instanced dungeons, and other RPG elements have been intertwined into the server to give the feeling of adventuring in minecraft a whole new meaning. In short, these plugins help the world feel as though you are truly in a Dungeons & Dragons like experience.

#### **RPG Skills & Progression**

Whether you are fighting, mining, fishing, or chopping down trees, you are developing your character and their associated skills. Through the use of MCMMO, players will be able to progress their characters in a multitude of fashions, earning new passive and active abilities, xp buffs, and much more.

#### **Minigames**

While not a main feature of our server (yet), a few minigames such as parkour and fishing competitions are in place. These allow you to enjoy some mindless fun when you need a break from town building and adventuring!

#### **An Advanced Economy & Trading System**

Economies are one of the most important aspects of a minecraft server and a driving force behind player interaction and progression. We have taken this aspect extremely seriously and have made sure it was the best it possibly could be. Players can trade amongst themselves, own bank accounts, employ other users by giving them an automated salary from said bank accounts, earn money through mob farming and other activities, create player shops, and interact with our own handmade shops. This is only a small percentage of our economies everexpanding feature list and much more regarding it can either be read on the wiki or experienced in game!

#### **Randomized World Events with Interesting Rewards**

Experience randomized mob spawns and boss fights around your location. Defeat these bosses and mobs for prizes and compete to be the number one boss slayer on the server! Currently, most of our randomized world events are handled by EliteMobs. This being said, we currently have multiple ideas and are workingo n implementation of them that will only add to these EliteMobs events!

#### **Fair & Non-Gameplay Affecting MTX**

From Day 1 we knew that hosting microtransactions that gave in game benefits would be something that could possibly be problematic. While it may provide more donations in the short term (and even long term), the last thing we wanted to do was make something where players felt unfairly balanced against their counterparts, let alone break Minecraft's very anti P2W EULA. For this and moral reasons, we decided it was best to stick with solely cosmetic donation rewards. For your support, users will be able to receive cosmetics such as mounts, particle effects, pets, and much more!
