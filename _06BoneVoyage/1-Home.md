# **Welcome to Bone Voyage**
## **IP: PLAY.MODLISTS.NET:25565**
## **[STORE](SMP.MODLISTS.NET)**

### **A Towny Adventure RPG Minecraft Server**

Bone Voyage Towny RPG is a Vanilla Minecraft 1.18 to 1.20.1 Server which promotes both the exploration and concepts of a modern Roleplaying Game whilst also adding elements of town building and the original vanilla feel of Survival Minecraft. This is an experience made by a group of developers with a background in creating new gameplay experiences and like our past projects, this is one that has been well planned, created, and will be continuously supported for the far forseeable future.

### **Some Features of Our Server**

#### **Towny & Ease of Access to Commands**

One of the primary plugins we use is towny. This allows you to build or join a town or nation, alone or with friends, and enjoy the town building experience minecraft was set to be. As many people know, Towny is chock full of different commands that players have to memorize and search for. This was something we knew would be a large hassle for our members, so we began searching for a solution. We were lucky enough to find one that came in the form of an in game menu. Gone are the days of remembering multiple commands to expand and build your towns and nations and with the simple use of the commands '/town create [name]' and '/t menu', you will be able to access all of the features of towny in a convenient manner. Of course the commands are stil an option for those more comfortable with the more analog style of features!

#### **New Structures, Dungeons, World Bosses, Guilds, Weapons, Armor, & a Plethora of Other RPG Like Changes**

Through the use of EliteMobs & Better Structures, you will now be able to find various new structures, mobs, dungeons, items, and so much more. In addition to this, quests, custom made instanced dungeons, and other RPG elements have been intertwined into the server to give the feeling of adventuring in minecraft a whole new meaning. In short, these plugins help the world feel as though you are truly in a Dungeons & Dragons like experience.
