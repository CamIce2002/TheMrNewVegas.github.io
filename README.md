## Welcome to the MNV Modlist Development Wiki!
This wiki encompasses the information regarding all modlists developed by members of the MNV Development team as well as myself. It was originally designed to be a wiki for only our Tale of Two Wastelands Capital Punishment list, but times have changed and our managed project list is growing exponentially. Primary categories will still be based upon Capital Punishment since it is our main list we are developing, but other lists such as Nostalgia will have their own sections near the bottom of the nav bar. Below is the latest development stream and the staff who help to create these awesome experiences!

## A Small Note

While we use the open source Just The Docs format, we have leaned heavily on the custom resources created by the talented [Wildlander Team's Wiki](http://wiki.wildlandermod.com). I will continue to try to improve from their format and change ours to not be a near replica and would like to thank them for providing the resources for me to be able learn and produce a quality product. If you are a fan of Skyrim, please check out their [Wildlander List](https://www.wildlandermod.com). It is the sole reason I got into making mod lists and I attribute nearly all of my ideas, work ethic, and general skillset to their hard work.
