## Project A.R.E.S.

Project A.R.E.S. is a suspenseful and dark quest mod about MedTek Corporation that so far introduces several new quest, two brand-new voiced NPC's, one brand-new handcrafted dungeon, a new store (and vendor), and new medicinal items to give your vault dweller a fighting chance in the wasteland.

## Quests

New Recipe? Write It Down: After discovering the new A.R.E.S. shop in downtown Boston, the robotic owner sends you on a mission to recover an old medical document located in a secret bunker that's been untouched since the bombs dropped.

Freedom!: Exploring an untouched MedTek Bunker can lead to horrifying discoveries of Pre-war MedTek and the types of experiments they run. Be careful, you never know what you'll find down there.

## NPC Additions
 
A.R.E.S. - Meet the owner and operator of the A.R.E.S. store...yep his name is also A.R.E.S.

The owner and operator, A.R.E.S., makes a new blend of drugs scavenged from MedTek research documents that give the users an upper-hand in most situations. Be warned, the prices aren't cheap as the drugs are premium.

MedTek Bunker: This secret MedTek Bunker hasn't been touched since the bombs dropped and is filled with horrifying discoveries of what pre-war MedTek was truly like. Terminals and notes detail the experience for all occupants.

## Fourville

## How to Start

Fourville is located near the town of Salem. The closest vanilla location is the town of Salem, to begin the mod travel there and head west across the bay. Fourville is marked with a gear icon.

## Lore

On the day of the Great War, the residents of Salem made their way to the shelter of Vault 4. Only those registered in the vault program were granted entrance. Some refugees reasoned that if they could wait out the twenty-year closure period, which Vault-Tec had advertised, then they would be able to find shelter when the vault opened.
More than two-hundred years later the town had changed a lot. A town grew up inside the cave outside the vault, its houses made from reclaimed Vault-Tec equipment and built into the walls of the cave which have been dug out as generations of residents tried to get inside the vault.
When the Sole Survivor arrives at Fourville the town is in the middle of an election where the vault has become a major point of contention. The town's incumbent mayor believes the vault will open one day, and has made this the focal point of his campaign. His challenger believes the vault is holding the town back and attempts to get inside should be abandoned. The Sole Survivor's involvement can shift the scale and change the face of the community forever.

## Features

Ten main quests.

 Forty-one side quests.

Seven radiant quests.

8-10 hours of gameplay.

 One companion, with full affinity and contextual dialogue, whose story develops as you travel together.
