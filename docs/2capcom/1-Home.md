## What is Capital Commonwealth?

Capital Commonwealth is a modlist inspired by Fallout 3's Capital Wasteland, with some bits of New Vegas sprinkled in, it's a harder list, but not to the point of being a chore to play. It maintains a gritty, unsafe, and dark atmosphere, without sacrificing fun, and playability. This list transforms the commonwealth into a barren, greenish wasteland, adds new PA features such as: Training requirements, PA scarcity, Impenetrable armor plating (until it breaks), and the ability to strike fear into your foes as you walk in the room.. It is now the walking tank it should be. As for other features, we have the FO3 and FNV leveling system, the Karma system, reputation, locational damage, mutations, and ghoul infestations!
