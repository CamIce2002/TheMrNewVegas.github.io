 ## Classic Power Armor Training

There are 4 fully voiced trainers located in the Commonwealth. They are located in mid game locations OR require you to make progress through the story line to unlock some of them. 

When entering Power Armor if you are not trained on the operation of the armor you will be ejected out shortly after stepping into the armor and will receive a pop up notice. 

## Power Armor Trainers

- Bunker Hill - Alex
  
- Prydwen - Knight Callahan

- Atom Cats' Garage - Sandy

- The Castle - Lt. Harrick

- Training Manual - Oil Rig Factory

## ﻿Some Assembly Required

Manually disables almost every Power Armor spawn location from the base game and replaces them with boss trunks, chems, weapons, ammo, and explosives. Basically, where ever you used to find a set of Power Armor, you'll find a supply cache.

Alters the Main Quest "Out of Time" ever-so-slightly, so that the Power Armor on top of the Museum only has the torso piece, which is at 10% health. 

Scatters Raider, T-45 and T-51 pieces all across the Commonwealth. Interiors, Exteriors, underwater, you name it! Encourages better looting and observation! Many areas where a full frame spawned now have one or two pieces of power armor. Military Bases, Bunkers and facilities relatively untouched since the Great War are good places to start looking, along with locations of great faction importance/high population.
Sets what few Power Armor spawns remain to Raider or T-45 (depending on the enemies who use it), and ensures that they do not respawn when the cell resets. So, you'll still have boss enemies in Power Armor. Boss Enemies that spawn in Power Armor, as opposed to entering it when the fighting starts, are unaltered and will respawn when the cell resets!

Changes vendor lists so that X-01/T-60 pieces won't show up

Alters the Quest Reward of Cambridge Polymer Labs to produce a T-45/T-51 variant

Adds severe perk restrictions for repairing Power Armor depending on model. Hope you've invested in Nuclear Physicist!

## Bastion - A Power Armor Overhaul

You become a real walking tank. Your power armor will shield you against damage. You won't take any damage, unless your Power Armor parts breaks or you get hit by projectiles, which can penetrate your armor.
But be careful, this also applies to your enemies!

- Low Penetration -﻿   20% of the damage will penetrate and damage the character.

- Medium Penetration -   40% of the damage will penetrate and damage the character.

- High Penetration -         60% of the damage will penetrate and damage the character.

## Other resistances:
Your Power Armor will also shield you against fire, poison, acid and radiation damage, as long as all power armor parts are above 25% durability.

## ﻿Enemies Fear Power Armor


Enemies notice when you're in power armor! If you initiate combat or kill an NPC while wearing power armor, hostiles now have a chance to run away in fear, similar to Terrifying Presence.

This is a very simple mod that makes power armor just a bit more intimidating to the average commonwealth scav, as it should have been from the start.

## You can cause enemies to run away in fear when you:

Start combat
Kill their allies 
Intimidate their allies

## Fear chance is calculated based off of your:

Strength SPECIAL stat
Intimidation Perk Rank
Rooted Perk Rank (When you are stationary)

## Power Armor Audio Overhaul

A complete change of the sounds power armor makes, from inserting the fusion core to the walking sounds to feel more like what it is - a walking hydraulic tank.﻿

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Power Armor Intercom Voice

A mod that makes the audio effect used for power armor helmets sound like an intercom, as if the helmet's speaker is somewhat worn out.﻿

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Power Armor HoloHUD

A nice, vanilla-like replacer for the PA hud that is friendly to UW users
