# Installation Guide

# Manual Install Guide Pending Wabbajack Integration Found [Here](https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/4347?tab=description)

# Part 1: Preinstallation

:::tip

We currently use rootbuilder. Not only does this save you space, but prevents any overwrites or edits occurring to your base game folder. 

Please follow the below instructions to the letter to ensure your base install remains unaffected/you can play the list successfully :). 

:::


## Requirements
:::note

- A Fresh Copy of Oblivion Remaster: Deluxe Edition in a **NONPROTECTED DIRECTORY** such as `Program Files`.
> The best place for your steam games is *always* the root of your drive
> 
> For example, this would be `C:\Steam\steamapps\common\Oblivion Remastered`
>
> You can relocate your Steam Library easily using [Lost Dragonist's Steam Library Tool](https://github.com/LostDragonist/steam-library-setup-tool/wiki/Usage-Guide)

- ~ 130 GB of Space

- [Net Runtime x64](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-8.0.5-windows-x64-installer)
- [Visual C++ x64](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)
- A Premium Nexus Membership is **HIGHLY** reccommended 
:::


**Step 1:** If you have it, ensure One Drive is disabled on your computer.
- A tutorial can be found [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/turn-off-disable-or-uninstall-onedrive-f32a17ce-3336-40fe-9c38-6efb09f944b0)

**Step 2:** Disable any third party anti-virus such as MalwareBytes.

**Step 3:** Ensure you have a clean install of Oblivion Remastered. You can do this by doing the following.
- If you have installed third party programs or mods, delete your Oblivion Remastered folder (Usually located at `C:\Steam\steamapps\common\Oblivion Remastered`)
- Additionally, go to your Windows Search Bar, type in `%USERS%`, from there navigate to `[Your Account]/Documents/My Games/Oblivion Remastered` and delete the Oblivion Remastered Folder
> If you have any saves you wish to keep, please ensure you back them up in a separate location before deleting this folder

**Step 4:** Reinstall Oblivion through Steam. Run the game once and open it to the main menu to allow file generation, then close out. 

# Part 2: Wabbajack Setup

**Step 5:** Download Wabbajack from [here](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/releases/latest/download/Wabbajack.exe)

**Step 6:** Place the downloaded .exe into a folder on the root of your drive (IE: `C:/Wabbajack`) and run it.

**Step 7:** In Wabbajack, go to the settings Cogwheel at the bottom right, then log in to your Nexus Account.
