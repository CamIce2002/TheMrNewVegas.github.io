## What is Dungeons & Daedra: Remastered?

Dungeons & Daedra: Remastered is an upcoming list for The Elder Scrolls IV : Oblivion Remaster. Based heavily off of its predecessor, Dungeons & Daedra of Oblivion Classic, D&DR attempts to turn the world of Oblivion into a reactive and exciting environment with exploration and thoughtful player choice at the center. You know longer are the center of the universe; Ill preparations and ego will be your downfall. With that in mind, with your character's growth comes immense strength and a much more rewarding experience. Are you truly deserving to hold the title Hero of Kvatch, Divine Crusader, or even Sheogorath?

This list is pending release; Please be on the look out both in our discord and here for updates to our documentation as we continue to develop and eventually release this list!
