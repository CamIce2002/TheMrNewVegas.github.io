# Necromancy & Vampirism Overhauls

## Necromancy

The infamous "Tome of Unlife" used by Lorgren Benirus seems to have a mind of its own, and has abandoned its former owner. The Tome of Unlife now sits atop the Altar of the Revenant, within the ancient Ayleid fane of Fanacasecul. Travel to Fanacasecul to begin your Dark Path as a Necromancer and touch the Tome of Unlife atop the Altar of the Revenant. This will activate the Altar of the Revenant, where you may now create brand new empty Black Soul Gems; Either by sacrificing your own vitality, or creating them within the Black Soul Gem Forge with Matrix Vitalis.

- You can now harvest 1 Human Heart (Matrix Vitalis) from every dead NPC (not creatures) using the appropriate spell given to you.
- You can now increase your Attributes with Matrix Vitalis at the Altar and can join/rank up within the Order of the Black Worm by sacrificing Matrix Vitalis at the Altar during "Communion".
- Each rank of the Order of the Black Worm confers a more powerful passive buff upon the player than the last, for a higher Matrix Vitalis cost each time.
- Within Fanacasecul, you can also find a note with information regarding the location of an ancient Tome of Blood Magic.
