# Ascension & NPC Overhauls

## Ascension

**Copied Directly From [Ascension Nexus Page](https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/706?tab=description)**

### Introduction

Ascension aims to create the definitive vanilla-plus Oblivion Remastered experience. Loot has been thoroughly overhauled so that rare equipment is actually rare, dungeons feel rewarding, enemies and loot no longer stop spawning at higher levels, underused gameplay aspects are made more worthwhile, and difficulty has been subtly increased overall. The sense of progression you receive from levelling up and journeying through the world of Oblivion should feel much greater with this mod installed.

Please note: this version of Ascension is a port of the original mod for Oblivion. Care has been taken to test the changes with the remaster to ensure that things work as intended. Due to changes in the remaster, some features could not be transferred over. However, as modding develops, I hope to update this mod so that we can have the Oblivion experience we always wanted!

### Leveled Lists and Loot

﻿Light armor is made from fur, leather, chainmail, mithril, elven or glass. Mithril, elven and glass are exceedingly rare and are only found in ancient ruins and remote tombs.... Blacksmiths can forge heavy armor from iron, steel, dwarven, orcish, ebony or daedric. Iron and steel plate mail can be found in most any blacksmith's shop. The other materials are rare and armor made from them is only found in ancient treasure hoards hidden deep underground.
Manual of Armor

- The quote above is taken from an in-game book. Lies! Once you get to a certain level in vanilla Oblivion, almost every wilderness bandit wears Ebony, Elven, Glass, and even Daedric armor.

No more. Ascension overhauls the loot system and changes how items are distributed throughout the game world. The items carried by NPCs and in loot are now capped at a certain level appropriate to the character and location. You won’t see bandits wearing anything above Chainmail armour, and generic loot has also been capped at Mithril and Orcish material. The best loot has been transferred to the boss chests located at the very end of dungeons, and only ancient tombs and ruins have a chance of concealing the highest level Glass, Elven, and Ebony gear. To find Daedric gear, you must travel to the plains of Oblivion itself, or delve deep into the twisted dungeons in the realm of the Mad God.

Furthermore, items will no longer stop spawning when you get to higher levels—iron armour will remain common throughout your adventure, as it should be.

Boss chests also contain various other valuable treasures, ranging from silver clutter to valuable gemstones and jewellery. This acts as the prize for completing a dungeon, and will be the primary source of income for dungeon delvers. Ayleid containers may also contain additional Welkynd Stones, and Varla Stones can even occasionally be found in boss chests. Thieves also have a chance of finding more valuable loot in homes across Cyrodiil.

### Creatures and NPCs

```
The highest rank of Dremora is the Valkynaz, or 'prince'. This warrior duke is a member of the Valkyn, Mehrunes Dagon's personal guard. The Valkynaz are rarely encountered on Tamriel; normally they remain by Mehrunes Dagon's side, or serve as commanders of operations of particular importance or interest to Dagon.

With Ascension, low-level creatures will no longer stop spawning when you get to a certain level. You can now always encounter Zombies, Imps, Scamps, etc regardless of your level. Furthermore, all random spawns points have been capped, so that tough creatures such as Liches, Minotaur Lords, Storm Atronachs, etc will now only spawn at boss-level points, usually at the end of dungeons. Boss chests contain the best loot, but they’re also the best guarded!

To balance this feature, some low level creatures now have a chance of spawning in groups once you reach higher levels. For example, you can now encounter a pack or wolves in the wilderness, or a squad of skeletons in a dungeon.

### Gameplay Balancing

Often overlooked by aspiring mages, Alchemy is a time-honored, rewarding discipline that can change the lives of those who master it.
Fundaments of Alchemy

A range of other tweaks balance various aspects of the game to make all play-styles feel more natural and worthwhile. These include changes to alchemy, sneak, pick-pocketing, hand-to-hand fighting, barter, persuasion, skill leveling rates, and more. Wherever possible, only minimal behind-the-scenes settings have been altered so that most information pertaining to the vanilla game's item and character stats is largely still correct.

- Although slight, these changes can have a large effect on how you play the game. For instance, playing an unarmed monk is now a perfectly valid choice, as hand-to-hand will remain a viable back-up combat skill throughout the game. Other examples include:
- Alchemy is less potent for those not skilled in the craft, and so it is harder to create potions more powerful than those found in loot for most characters.
- Persuasion and barter are much harder unless a character specialises in them—some merchants may not even haggle with novice mercantile characters at all!
- Spellswords may need to trade armour for clothing to maintain high spell effectiveness at low levels, as the effect of this mechanic has been increased.
- Repairing items is less frustrating for low-level characters, as the chance of breaking repair hammers has been decreased. However, the amount of condition restored per hammer strike now scales much more with Armorer skill. This is a worthwhile endeavor, as repairing items at vendors is now more expensive.
- Pickpocketing chances are also more reasonable, and pickpocketing grants more skill experience than in vanilla, making it actually viable.

- Additionally, item value and rarity has been tweaked to make more sense for the game world. This includes a thorough rebalance of magic item costs so that you can't easily get rich by selling weak enchanted items found in dungeons.
