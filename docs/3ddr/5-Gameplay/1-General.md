# General Gameplay

## Starting Off

You start in the Imperial City Prison with two options. Either continuing as was intended through the Imperial Prison Sewers, or skipping the introduction using the **Gravestone Quickstart**. Both are self explanatory, but please read below for the latter.

**Gravestone Quickstart**

In your jail cell, there will be a tomb stone. Activate the tombstone to pull up the menu you would see at the end of The Sewers before exiting.
- In this menu, make any final edits to your appearance, name, and race in addition to assigning your birthsign/class.

:::warning 

If you use this, ensure that you are happy with your character customization and that you **have selected your class/birthsign** before selecting to exit the option to exit The Sewers.

You **CAN** leave without a Birthsign/Class and will end up having a very nerfed character.

## Difficulty, Healing, & Damage Scaling

[Difficulty Remastered](https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/624) is used as it best complements our main overhaul, Ascension.
- It is **recommended** that you place the difficulty on Adept for the best experience. Damage from Player:NPC is 1:1 and this setting will provide the best challenge.

- Environmental damage is currently being focused, with the current biggest focus being Lethal Lava. Gone are the days of bunny hopping across lava pools to cheese Oblivion Gates.
- Health, Fatigue, & Magicka Potions now regenerate their effects over time. You can still drink multiple potions, but healing only happens after you close the inventory and unpause the game, making potion use feel more natural and preventing instant full recovery during pause.
- Poisons now apply their damage gradually over 5 seconds, including Nature, Frost, Fire, and Shock effects — allowing for more tactical use and letting your enemies suffer over time.
- Ale, Beer, & Mead now restore a small amount of fatigue over 10 seconds.

## Exploration & Fast Travel

After leaving the sewers, you will notice that fast travel is disabled and that many of the city markers are no longer available. The main goal of this list is to promote careful exploration and discovery, but to also allow for you to move around freely once you reach the end game. 
- To highlight my point of moving around freely, once reaching the cities and various locations in the world, you will notice a pay for service similar to Skyrim's carriage system which allows you to fast travel to certain points on the map at a cost.
- **Stable Travel NPC's:** These are NPC's located at all of the main city stables in the game. They will take you to any main city. 
- **Chorrol + Bruma Stable Travel:** After unlocking Battlehorn Castle & Frostcrag Spire, you will be able to use the Stable NPC's in Chorrol to travel to Battlehorn and Bruma to travel to Frostcrag
- **Guild Hall Travel NPC's:** These are Mage NPC's located at all Guild Halls which will allow you to travel to any other Guild Hall. The initial cost is 200 gold/teleport and is reduced to 100 gold/teleport after reaching Arch Mage.
- **Boats:** There are two useable boats in the world; the one at the Anvil & Bravil docks. These will take you to and from Dunbarrow Cove and Deepscorn Hollow respectively. You must unlock these player homes to have access to their fast travels.
- **Horse Whistle:** This is a power you can use like any spell/other power. When you use it, it whistles for your horse and your horse appears/starts following you!

## Simple Hunting Overhaul
- Hunting animals will now provide more pelts, meats, and animal materials. This is now a sufficient way to make a living in Cyrodill! 

## Guild Advancement

You can no longer be a Novice Mage/Fighter & also be a leader of the Mages/Fighters Guild. You will have to take the time to train your crafts. Below are the minimum skill requirements for each rank within the Mages Guild & Fighter's Guild

### **Mages Guild**

- Magic Skills include Alchemy, Alteration, Conjuration, Destruction, Illusion, Mysticism, and Restoration. Below are the number of skills you will need to have at certain levels to ascend to the next rank.
- If you are attempting to get through the questline as quickly as possible, it is best that you pick and focus on three skills until they have reached Expert, then focusing on one of these three until it reaches Master.

**Associate:** No Skill Requirements
**Apprentice:** 3 Apprentice﻿﻿﻿﻿ Skills From List Above
**Journeyman:** 1 Journeyman﻿﻿﻿﻿ Skill from List Above
**Evoker:** 2 Journeyman﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ Skills from List Above

### **Fighters Guild**

- Fighting Skills include Blade, Blunt, Block, Hand to Hand, Athletics, Heavy Armor, and Armorer. Below are the number of skills you will need to have at certain levels to ascend to the next rank.
- If you are attempting to get through the questline as quickly as possible, it is best that you pick and focus on three skills until they have reached Expert, then focusing on one of these three until it reaches Master.

### Radiant Guild Quests

- Each guild now has radiant quests which infinitely populate, allowing for constant replayability and a way to earn gold/rewards for doing simple tasks
- The gold rewards from these quests also scale with the player's level!
- In addition to this, radiant dungeon quests have been added to the Mage's Guild to add even more excitement to the radiant system.
- For more information visit the appropriate nexus pages or the wiki documentation.

## Magic Changes

- Conjurers Rejoice! As you level Conjuring you will now be granted the ability to summon more than one summoned creature.
> **Level 50 Conjuration** = 2 Summons; **Level 75 Conjuration** = 3 Summons; **Level 100 Conjuration** = 4 Summons
- On the flip side of this, Necromancy is now **Banned**. Using Undead Summons near Mage's Guild Members will cause for expulsion from the Mage's Guild. Additionally, Undead Summons near guards will cause you to gain a 100 gold bounty.
- Necromancy has also been overhauled so that the player may participate if they so choose thanks to the [Dark Path of Necromancy](https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/2531?tab=description). Please visit the Nexus/Appropriate documentation page on the wiki for more information on this overhaul.


## Player Homes
- Currently, all vanilla player homes and their additions cost the same. The only home that is edited to look and feel different is the Waterfront Shack in the Imperial City
- Most DLC homes are still very easy to get if you know their locations. Mods will be added to mitigate this as they are released, with only Frostcrag Spire currently having requirements before obtaining.
> To Obtain Frostcrag, you will need to kill Mannimarco during the Mage's Guild Questline and take the key off of him.
