_"A heretic may see the truth and seek redemption. He may be forgiven his past and be absolved in death. A Traitor can never be forgiven. A Traitor can never find peace in this world or the next. There is nothing as wretched or as hated in all the world as a Traitor."_

## What is Ordo Hereticus?
### [Nexus Collection Link](https://next.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kdarktide/collections/rzdfo4)

Ordo Hereticus is a customizable, former Nexus collection for Warhammer 40,000: Darktide that makes the game more streamlined and fun. It features a host of quality of life additions, UI tweaks and changes, additional character slots, and full Mod Organizer 2 support. Work is currently being done to move it to a Wabbajack list. It (most likely) won't be hosted on the UI, but in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/43EhRjU).
