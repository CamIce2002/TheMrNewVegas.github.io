## **What is Path of the Incarnate?**
Path of the Incarnate is an original mod list for OpenMW, aiming to offer a fresh, stable, and immersive Morrowind experience. This is all accomplished while preserving the alien charm the vanilla game exuded. From new quests, landmass overhauls & additions, hundreds of new items & NPCs, enhanced combat & leveling, graphical improvements, and much more, you'll be able to experience this Bethesda classic with 20+ years of community love, all in an easy-to-install package.

## **What is it Not?**
- **A Modifiable List (For the Time Being):** As we iron out issues with the compiled list we have no time to support extra additions to the list
- **A Vanilla/Vanilla+ Experience:** This is by no means a small or vanilla+ list+
