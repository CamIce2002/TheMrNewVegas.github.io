:::info
## Before you Start
Make sure that you have a clean install of Darktide in a non-protected folder. Old mod files or loaders can cause crashing issues.

[Follow this if you don't know how to move Steam games.](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/4BD4-4528-6B2E-8327)

## Installation
- [Download the .wabba file from here.](https://mega.nz/file/He4FyCDZ#qgITsRUyA10Tv4LX-cNgzicPkv5cG_GRvc3THF9kEzs) For the time being it isn't on the UI.
- Run Wabbajack and select Install from Disk in the top right
- Select the downloaded .wabba file
- Set your paths (ie. D:\Wabbajack\Modlists\Darktide\Ordo Hereticus)
- Click Install

## Post-Install
- Go to the folder you set in Wabbajack and open MO2.exe
- Scroll down to Mod Settings at the bottom
- Right Click, Open in Explorer
- Copy the Fatshark folder
- Go to C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming
- Paste the Fatshark folder, overwrite if prompted
- Go back to MO2 and click Run

:::caution
Game settings and Mod Settings seem to be the same file, so using my included Mod Settings file will overwrite any of your settings. You should be okay to launch into game with these settings, just make sure to check your game settings.
If you're having issues, you can run the launcher through Steam and update your settings there. Just make sure you close the launcher and relaunch through MO2.

## Updating 
I recommend checking for mod updates before every time you play just you make sure you're always up to date.
- To do this, right click on any of the mods in the left panel, mouse over ALL MODS, then click CHECK FOR UPDATES.
- Right click mods that need updating, click VISIT ON NEXUS, download the most recent mod version.
  
The list will typically only be updated for mod addition, removals, or large mod updates.
