## What is BLEP?

BLEP MC is a modpack for Forge 1.20.1 that seeks to overhaul most aspects of the game to encourage the building of infrastracture across the world to get around and transport items.

All forms of instant teleporation have been disabled aside from a "Fast Travel" system requiring roads to be built between locations.

Enchanting has also been modified to now require the building of a full library to achieve powerful enchantments.
