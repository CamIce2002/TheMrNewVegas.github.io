Gone are the days of throwing down 15 bookshelves and having access to every enchantment for the rest of the game! Now enchanting involves the building of a full library decorated with countless objects from your journeys to obtain the most powerful of enchantments.

## Enchanting Stats

### Primary
* Eterna - A measure of enchanting strength, increases the level cost
* Quanta - A measure of randomness, changing just how much RNG is involved
* Arcana - A measure of mystical quality, increases the number of enchantments received while making rare enchantments more common

### Secondary
* Enchanting Clues - Changes the number of enchantments shown when hovering a slot in the Enchanting Table
* Stability - Removes the negative randomness from Quanta

## Bookshelves

* Basic - Any basic bookshelf crafted with planks and three books.

* Archivist - Filled with written books, provides more Eterna than the basic.

* Enchanted - Filled with enchanted books, provides enough Eterna to get Level 30 enchantments with 15 shelves.

* Elemental - Shelves crafted from elemental reagents from across the realms. More powerful than convential bookshelves.

* Infused - Elemental shelves infused with pure Eterna.
