# Boneyard Creations Wiki

### Welcome to the Boneyard Creations Wiki!

![bannerl2rv2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112358568/227137823-9d40c675-4193-4547-a7f5-e4dc66423c50.png)

This wiki encompasses the information regarding all modlists developed by members of the Boneyard Creations Staff Team. From our original list, Capital Punishment, to our currently active lists such as Halls of Sovngarde, we truly hope you enjoy each experience we have hand crafted for you! Additionally, none of this would be possible without the volunteers who have spent countless hours working on open source mods, readable guides/materials, and more for these games we love. The credit should always be given to them first and foremost and I hope that you all take the time to endorse a few of your favorites, leave an encouraging comment, or show them love in some other form when you install any list.

## Credits

- **The Wildlander Team:** When we originally released our wiki, our resources were heavily dependent on the hard work put into the [Wildlander Team's Wiki](http://wiki.wildlandermod.com). Without their open and friendly attitude to us using this code to create our own, we would likely not have begun searching for a means to have an open web platform. If you are a fan of Skyrim, please check out their [Wildlander List](https://www.wildlandermod.com). It is the sole reason I got into making mod lists and I attribute nearly all of my ideas, work ethic, and general skillset to their hard work.

- **The Boneyards Creation Team:** I want to thank the development & support members of this team. They sacrificed hours of their free time and put those hours into Capital Punishment and our other lists. I am extremely grateful to have both their dedication and support and look forward to our future endeavors as a team. 

- **The Donators**
Whether you have donated through discord, patreon, kofi, or any other mode, we appreciate you immensely! It has allowed the team & myself to give financial recompensation to some of our hardworking team members, helped in running giveaways for the discord, and even helped in obtaining new hardware for streams and ensuring our modlists can be backed up locally!

- **Countless Mod Authors:** Disagreements and agreements aside, none of this would be possible without the hard work of the mod authors behind each and every mod you find in one of our lists. A large thank you to all of them for providing these resources.

- **And Many Other Individuals:** If you are not named here, please know it is not for a lack of appreciation. A plethora of different individuals have helped us in many different ways. From content creators such as **[Biggie Boss](https://www.youtube.com/@biggie_boss)** and **[Skoldire](https://www.youtube.com/@skoldire)** who have shared our lists with their larger audiences to technical advisors such as **[Salamand3r](https://salamand3r.fail)** & **[WallSOGB](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/22363364?tab=user+files)**, whose knowledge that far exceeds our own has helped to shape early and current iterations of Capital Punishment. There have been many individuals along the way and without them, our ability to succeed would likely have been hindered or cut short. Thank you to all of you, you know who you are!
