## New Vegas Skill System

By default, you must spend all perk points and skill points after you level up. 

By default, you only gain a perk point every 2 levels.

You gain 10 + INT/2 skill points per level. At 3 intellgence, you would gain 11.5 SP each level up. The system remembers half points.

Luck gives 1% critical hit chance per current value, up to 10. Anything over 10 only provides 10% crit chance

Hacking terminals and lockpicking doors now requires a base of 25 Science and Lockpick respectively to do the minigame for Novice level locks. Each 25 skill level increases your ability to lockpick/hack higher lock levels.
