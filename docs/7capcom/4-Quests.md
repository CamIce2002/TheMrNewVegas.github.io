- 15+ consumables, many returning from Fallout 3

- Various Point Lookout themed workshop items


## America Rising 2

You've found yourself in a world that is now foreign to you. Everything you once loved and held dear has been taken in the blink of an eye -
replaced instead by a vile and twisted wasteland. What if you had a way
to bring it all back? Is it all too good to be true?


**Features**

- A 24 quest main storyline seamlessly integrated into Fallout 4 with meaningful player choice

- Help build the Enclave - or destroy them

- An evolving base that restores as you progress through the game

- A large cast of unique characters

- One main companion and two additional followers

- Multiple new random encounters

- New Enclave equipment, settlement decorations and skins

- Multiple new locations and worldspaces

- An Enclave Radio station with music and announcements

- Repeatable quests


## Outcasts and Remnants

To start the mod's main story, head to the B.O.G. bunker, which is built into a hill, located south of Oberland Station, just east of the railroad tracks, and southwest of the alien crash site.  Head there and talk to Chuck Finley.  Once you discover the B.O.G. Bunker, you can fast travel to and from the interior.

For immersion and game-play difficulty purposes, you should first complete the main Fallout 4 quest "Reunions", where you confront Kellogg at Fort Hagen, after which the first quest in this mod, "Initiation", should start automatically the next time you change locations.


**Features**

- New quests, locations, factions, and companions.
- 20 hour story, with repeatable quests
