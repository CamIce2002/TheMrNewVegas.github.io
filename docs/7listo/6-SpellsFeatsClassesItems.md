# New and Changed Spells

## Skill Actions

These aren't really "Spells" per say, but [Skill Actions](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/13705) adds new abilities to all characters based on their skill proficiencies. One of the very important skills added is using Perception to search for invisible enemies.

## Rebalanced Spells

[Valdacil's Spell Adjustments](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/4426) makes a number of critical changes to various vanilla BG3 spells. Namely:

* Hex is now something you cast at the start of the day. It costs 1 slot to cast the first time - but once it is prepared, you will gain a _new_ hex spell on your hotbar called "Hex Target." This is what you use to actually apply the hex to an enemy. The spell applies disadvantage on all ability checks (you don't pick one), otherwise it works as normal. Re-casting the spell to target new creatures costs a bonus action but not more spell slots. Cast Hex at the start of the day to prepare the spell, and then use Hex Target to actually hex enemies during encounters.
* Hunter's Mark works the same way. Cast Hunter's Mark, then use Mark Target to apply the effect to targets.
* Shield of Faith lasts until long rest and does not require Concentration.
* Many spells can be upcasted to have multiple targets and will scale to 9th level.
* Compelled duel makes an enemy want to target you, but it also gives you advantage to hit them.
* Divine Favor's bonus to damage scales with spell level.
* Ray of Sickness and Ray of Enfeeblement chain to nearby targets, scales with upcasting.

Speak with Animals and Longstrider are AoE casts that last until long rest, dramatically decreasing the management necessary to prepare your adventuring party each morning. Shillelagh lasts until long rest [and can be applied to a wider variety of weapons](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/4932).

## 5e, Homebrew, and Spells Extra

[5e Spells](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/125) adds a variety of tabletop spells missing from BG3. [Valdacil's adjustment mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/4426?tab=description) rebalances several of the spells based on the philosophy Larian applied with the spells they included in the game. So expect the spells you love from D&D but don't expect all of them to work exactly like they do in the book.

[Homebrew Spells](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/473) adds a small selection of additional 0th - 5th level spells. Similar to Valdacil, [a rebalance mod is used](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/1590?tab=description) to translate the spells better to BG3.

[Spells Extra](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/11291) is used to cover any missing spells needed by Luma's various subclass mods.

[Valdacil's Mystic Rebalance](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/4426) changes how some Mystic features/abilities/psionic foci/spells work compared to the mod page descriptions.

As an _optional mod_, [PF2e Spells](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/2460) is included in Listonomicon. It adds a very large variety of spells, however it also adds several spells that overlap with BG3/5e, uses different scaling math per spell slot level, and has other features that are not explained well in tooltips and spell descriptions (if at all). It also introduces Action -> Bonus Action conversion, which is a whole host of balance issues. Enable the mod if you love having a ton of variety in your spell options, leave it disabled if you don't want to deal with the wonk.

## New and Changed Feats

In Listonomicon, all classes earn a feat at a rate of one per 3 levels. Fighters and Rogues earn an additional feat at level 11. So all classes get a feat at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18; Fighters and Rogues get a feat at 3, 6, 9, 11, 12, 15, and 18.

The [Arcanist Feat](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/1087) allows you to gain +1 INT, gain expertise in Arcana, and learn any level 1 spell which can be casted once per short rest. Consider how various level 1 spells (such as Shield of Faith) have been rebalanced. That's basically a free +2 AC for anyone who would not otherwise have access to the spell, such as an Eldritch Knight.

The [Caustic Feat](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/10031) adds a Poison version of the Elemental Adept feat. It also reduces poison immunity to poison resistance, meaning poison builds are not _completely_ useless in Act 2. The Poisoner's Robe (looted from the Phase Spider Matriarch) adds extra damage to all sources of poison damage. For example, a Green Dragonborn Circle of Spores Druid who takes Caustic and wears the robe would get the benefits of the feat (reroll 1's, reduce immunity to resistance, ignore resistance) and the +1d4 damage to their breath weapon, spore attack, and poison damage spells.

[Essential Feats](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/5623) adds a great variety of feats. For multiclass melee-caster builds, War Magic allows you to combine casting with weapon swinging. This is especially great for Clerics who otherwise do not get access to extra attack or war priest extra attack, as you can combine a cast and a swing every turn. Deadly Alacrity reduces the number needed to roll a crit (stacks with any/other crit chance increase effects) and restores mobility for hits and kills, though Listo removes the +1 stat bonus. Alchemist turns anyone into a potion throwing utility character. And various Initiate, Touched, and Adept feats give limited access to the features of other classes such as a fighting maneuver, eldritch invocation, or metamagic. Using these feats is an alternative to Arcanist, and the user gains 2 cantrips and 1 spell of 1st level. A great use of these feats is to get Shillelagh as a non-Nature Cleric or Monk, without needing to dip into Druid. A Sorcerer or Bard could pick up eldritch blast, another Warlock cantrip, and mage armor.

[Rebalance Feats](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/5614) changes a few feats in BG3 to be more or less powerful. Specifically, Great Weapon Master and Sharpshooter are seperately rebalanced by [this mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/3315).

[Enweaved](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/13310) adds a way to get +2 in INT, WIS, or CHA - but be warned, it comes with wild magic and _wild magic allergy_! This can help a caster reach 22 in their casting stat (and get to 24 with Hag's Hair + the relevant Tome) but it will make casting spells, and being around spellcasting, a dangerous gabmit.

[Experimental Alchemy as a Feat](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/12446) provides another way to get access to Experimental Alchemy, which potentially causes two potions to be brewed instead of one when using alchemy. Note that multiple ExpAlch sources do not stack (eg Wizard + Artificer + this feat would still only produce 2 potions).

As an _optional mod_, [Titan's Grip](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/12712) is included in Listonomicon. This feat allows dual wielders to ignore normal game restrictions and use two-handed weapons. It is very unbalanced but provided as an option.

# New and Changed Classes and Subclasses

It's going to take a while to write up what each these changes does to the game.

## General Changes and Additions

[Expansion Level 13-20](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/279)

Adds level scaling up to level 20. Also implements several changes/optional rules introduced with Tasha's Cauldron of Everything and other publications.

[Smart Cunning Action](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/8906)

Changes the Rogue (Thief) double bonus action to instead be a toggle ability allowing rogues to choose to use their action or bonus action for cunning actions. Also grants this benefit to monks.

## Wild Magic

These mods effect wild magic sorcerers, wild magic barbarians, and/or other situations where the wild magic effects table is rolled such as certain wild magic enemies, controlled chaos, or having the Enweaved feat. Sorcerers and creatures with wild magic should only accrue surge risk during combat, with the chance increasing 5% per spell casted until a surge is triggered. For player sorcerers, you can avoid starting the wild magic risk slide by avoiding using Tides of Chaos, but that would be boring. Wild magic surges will restore Tides of Chaos, allowing you to keep it going multiple times throughout an adventuring day. Wild Magic Sorcerers in Listonomicon are a whacky risk-reward gameplay experience.

* [More Wild Magic effects](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/2022)
* [Wild Magic D100 Table](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/2967)
* [Increasingly Likely Wild Magic Surge](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/9603) (Combat Only)

[If Volo dies for any reason](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/4030), the Weave will begin unraveling and _all magic becomes wild magic_.

## Barbarian

[Dynamic Wildheart Barbarian](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/8274) changes wildheart barbarians (aka "Totem") to be able to change which animal aspect is called upon when raging, which makes the subclass easier to adapt to different situations.

[5e Reckless Attack Toggle](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/10924) changes the Reckless Attack feature from a reaction, to a toggled status.

New subclasses:

* Path of the Zealot - Your fervor inspires you to fight beyond death, and even if you die, your allies can revivify you for free.
* Path of the Ancestral Guardian - You channel the spirits of your clan, bloodline, or faith. When you rage, spectral warriors swarm around you to slay your foes.
* Path of the Juggernaut
* Path of the Storm Herald - Your rage is that of thunderstorms, sandstorms, blizzards, and worse. When you rage, you surround yourself with elemental damage.
* Path of the Giant - Your rage allows you to fight like a creature twice your size. As your Barbarian level increases, your rages become bigger and their bonuses to your strength, attacks, thrown weapons, and shoves increases with it.

## Bard

* College of Creation - Creation Bards are able to spawn pillars that help allies or hinder enemies, and focus on the caster and support aspects of Bard.
* College of Eloquence
* College of Dance - Dance Bards enjoy a hybrid playstyle that is part healer/support caster, and part monk.

## Cleric

[Blessing of the Trickster](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/11566) is buffed to apply to more skills, and can be activated during dialogue similar to the Guidance spell. Trickery Clerics are a little less bad.

* Zeal Domain - Zeal Clerics have similar benefits to Tempest Clerics, but use their Channel Divinity to maximize the damage of thunder and fire spells.
* Strength Domain
* Ambition Domain
* Solidarity Domain
* Order Domain
* Inquisition Domain - Inquisition Clerics focus on being frontline melee combatants specialized in shutting down enemy spellcasters. Their class features include similar benefits to the Mageslayer feat, they deal extra damage to enemies concentrating on spells, and they can apply protective boons to their companions to resist enemy spells.

## Druid

[Druid Quality of Life](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/3214) is a QoL mod (duh) that changes many spells, effects, and magic items to interact with wildshape among other fixes.

[Circle of the Spores Druid Damage Choice](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/11252) gives Spore druids the choice of dealing extra necrotic, acid, or poison damage with their class abilities, reducing how much this class suffers in Act 2 and creating new paths for synergy. [Combined with Spore Druid Extra Attack](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/4018) and the improved Shillelagh spell, Spore Druids are a very respectable frontline melee combat/utility cast/healer and a good choice for players who want to play a Druid but do not want to use Wildshape.

Druids always have Speak With Animals prepared. They gain find familiar and flock of familiar at the appropriate levels. The Goodberry spell is buffed. Shilelagh is more powerful, is a permanent effect, and applies to a wider variety of weapons.

## Fighter

Eldritch Knight weapon bonds are permanent, similar to Warlock Pact of the Blade weapon bonds. You no longer need to remember to redo your bond every morning.

New Subclasses:

* Banneret (Purple Dragon Knight) - The Banneret is focused on being a battlefield commander. Their abilities include directing their allies to make extra attacks and improving the potential of other melee allies around them.
* Arcane Archer - The Arcane Archer uses Intelligence to imbue their ranged attacks with magical effects. These can increase damage, temporarily banish targets, bind foes, and other abilities.
* Rune Knight (with Inscribe Once QoL optional file) - The Rune Knight uses the power of magic runes to improve their potential. Their options and number of benefits increase with their level. They choose a number of runes to inscribe, which come with benefits in and out of combat such as advantage on certain skills, or triggers to deal extra damage. They can also make themselves (temporarily) bigger.
* Samurai - Samurai are focused on being relentless combatants. They have a limited number of charges per day to grant themselves advantage on all attacks for a turn, plus temporary HP. They can forego advantage to make additional attacks, having the highest potential attacks-per-turn of any fighter.
* Cavalier - While mounts, and therefore mounted combat, does not exist in BG3, the Cavalier is able to fight with the spirit of a knightly heavy cavalry. The Cavalier has boosts to their speed and attacks that allow them to charge across great distances to smack foes. They can also inspire greater mobility among teammates.
* Echo Knight (with RAW Progression optional file) - Echno Knight is a weird class. You make a shadowy copy of yourself, and can attack using your own body or using your doppleganger.
* Psi Warrior - like the Eldritch Knight and Arcane Archer, the Psi Warrior uses Intelligence as a hybrid combat caster. The Psi Warrior focuses on empowering their attacks with extra psychic damage and psi abilities.

## Monk

[Monk 5e Adjustments](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/1411) makes key QoL changes to various aspects of monks, such as supporting unarmed strikes even while you have a weapon in your hands.

New Subclasses:

* Way of the Long Death - These monks empower their ki-attacks with extra necrotic damage.
* Way of the Astral Self
* Way of the Sun Soul
* Way of the Ascendant Dragon
* Way of the Kensei - The Kensei is a Monk focused on the expert use of melee weapons and bows, and can use their ki to empower traditional Monk weapons as well as unusual choices like longswords.
* Way of the Drunken Master - The Drunken Master offers a combination of defensive and offensive abilities to the Monk, using the faux appearance of intoxication to mask their agility and deft strikes.
* Way of Mercy

## Paladin

Start with Othbreaker Unlocked allows players to begin the game as an Oathbreaker. Note that this will block respec'ing until/unless the character atones with the Oathbreaker Knight, even if your plan is to continue being an Oathbreaker. This is a BG3 limitation. Unholy Oathbreakers adds a necrotic version of Smite for Oathbreakers. All Paladins should have their passive aura buff range extended to 9m/30 feet instead of the abysmal 3m/9 feet of vanilla.

New Subclasses:

* Oath of Redemption
* Oath of Zeal - Zeal Paladins use their fervor to increase their own speed as well as to inspire allies.
* Oath of Conquest - Conquest Paladins focus on overwhelming their enemies and crushing their spirit. They use fear and terror, and react to missed attacks with furious retribution.

## Ranger

[Displacer Beast as a Ranger Companion](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/12352) adds displacer beast as a ranger companion option.

New Subclasses:

* Swarmkeeper
* Monster Slayer
* Horizon Walker

## Rogue

[Second-Story Work Dexterity Jump](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/6331) changes the benefit of Second-Story Work to allow your jump to scale based on your Dexterity, instead of Strength.

## Sorcerer

[Tides of Chaos Recharge](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/11625) changes ToC to reset after a wild magic surge is caused, allowing you to use it multiple times per long rest (and risk multiple surges throughout the day as a result). [Metamagic Extended](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/405) implements more metamagic options from the tabletop game. The metamagic to change the damage type of your spell requires activating the metamagic, and then selecting an element out of the new pop-up options. Expand the section of your hotbar that has metamagic in it to see the new options. [Draconic bloodline sorcerers](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/13563) have significantly more options now.

New Subclasses:

* Aberrant Mind - These Sorcerers overlap with GOO Warlocks in many ways. They cause fear on spell attack crits, and at higher levels can use their sorcery points to cast a number of great Warlock spells.
* Shadow Sorcery - Shadow Sorcerers are immune to the Shadowcurse, can see in magical darkness, and can use their sorcery points for necromancy spells.
* Favored Soul - Favored Souls are a hybrid Cleric-Sorcerer. They pick a Cleric domain and gain a number of bonus spells from that domain, and are the only sorcerers with access to healing spells.

## Warlock

[Invocations Expanded](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/13234) adds more invocation options from the published books.

New Subclasses: 

* The Undead - The Undead is able to adopt the visage of their undead patron (such as a vampire or mummy) for temporary HP and limited powers.
* The Celestial - The Celestial is a Warlock with access to healing spells, and charges that can be spent on a unique healing ability.

## Wizard

* Hierophant - Hierophants are Wizards with limited imitation of Cleric abilities, including healing spells and the ability to shelter those they heal from further harm.
* Bladesinger - Bladesingers are melee wizards.

## Brand New Classes

* [Artificer](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/1779), and all subclasses.
* [Mystic](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/2786), and Mystic Expansion.

# Inspiration For Builds and Fun Ideas

The heavy caveat to this section is that Baldur's Gate 3, like any game, can be optimized to the point that you have optimized the fun out of the experience. Generally you should follow basic common sense decision making (don't dump Intelligence as a wizard, for example), but Listonomicon is not designed around the expectation that players will make perfectly optimized parties and carefully pour over all of the math to determine the most powerful gear combination they can assemble. Listonomicon is designed around being a more rewarding challenge than vanilla Tactician so that veteran RPG players can have a refreshing experience. If you want to break Listonomicon, you will. If you want to focus on having fun, you can.

## General Notes

1-level dips and 3-level dips into many classes are an easy way to get essential hybrid synergies. Because Listo grants feats every 3 levels, there is no sacrifice for dipping 3 and not continuing to 4.

1 level of Life Domain Cleric will instantly make anyone a better healer. Starting as a Life Domain Cleric will come with medium armor and a shield proficiency. A Celestial Warlock, Bard, Hierophant Wizard, or Divine Soul Sorcerer that wants powerful utility healing in a pinch can take their first level as a Life Domain Cleric for a healing boost and dump dexterity.

1 Level of Tempest Domain or Zeal Domain Cleric will make you better at lightning damage, or fire and thunder damage, a limited number of times per short rest. Again, starting in Cleric grants medium armor and a shield. By activing Tempetous Wrath or the equivalent Zeal ability, you can cause one spell dealing the associated damage type to deal maximum damage. This is great for a single-target spell if you really want to keep a nuke in your back pocket, but it also applies to AOE, cone, and line spells. A Zeal Cleric 1 / Sorcerer 19 could drop a 9th level fireball and guarantee everyone hit is making their dex save against a max damage roll.

Warlocks pick invocations at level 3. Options include Agonizing Blast, which turns Eldritch Blast into the most consistent source of DPS available in the game. They also choose a pact feature, of which Pact of the Blade is a choice. This allows you to transform any 1 melee weapon into a Pact Weapon, which retains its own stats except that it uses your Charisma to attack, and you are always considered proficient. This has great synergy with Sorcerer, Bard, and Paladin, who also rely on Charisma as a primary stat. You can dump Strength and Dexterity, and attack with your Pact Weapon or Eldritch Blast when you run out of spell slots or uses for your other class(es) abilities.

At level 3, Artificers can become Battlesmiths. Battlesmiths use their Intelligence when attacking with any magical weapon (melee or ranged). They do not gain universal proficiency like a Pact Weapon, but otherwise any magical weapon they are proficient in becomes deadly. Artificers can therefor focus on maximizing Intelligence, while dumping Strength and Dexterity, and still be reliable in combat. This provides great synergy with Eldritch Knight or Psionic Fighters, all Wizards, and the Mystic class, as it combines your weapon attacks and your spellcasting under one stat. Artificers are also the only class natively proficient in firearms, and can use their artificing powers to transform a musket into a double-shot weapon that deals 1d12+ force damage. This also turns it into a magical weapon, using Intelligence instead of Dexterity. This will synergize with anything that makes ranged combat better, such as the Sharpshooter feat, or archery fighting style. An Artificer 3 could pivot into Rogue, and would have two attacks a round with their magic musket, giving two opportunities to trigger a sneak attack. An Artificer Battlesmith could pivot into Ranger, and succeed in two-weapon fighting and ranged combat, using Intelligence for both.
