## **What is Listonomicon?**
The goal of the “Listonomicon” is to be an out-of-the-box experience that enhances Baldurs Gate 3’s UI, quality of life, and replay value; introduces beloved aspects of the tabletop game’s past and present; and widens and deepens the game mechanics while respecting Larian’s vision for adapting DnD5e to an enjoyable cRPG.

The road through the early-early game is smoothed out, but the challenge of late Act One and Act Two is stretched to hopefully last longer. Act Three should remain interesting and challenging, with a mixture of enjoyable power fantasy as you overpower faceless henchmen, and high stakes, as many bosses are specifically tweaked to push your party's limit. With the tweaks, difficulty enhancements, and changes, Listonomicon still seeks to avoid creating a slog - no one enjoys fighting over tuned bags of excess HP protected by obnoxious AC. We do not find brick walls fun!

The passion for compiling this list is born of the unexpected love that BG3 reignited for _Dungeons and Dragons_ - but Listo would not be possible without the hard work of unpaid fans and mod makers. Lilly and I share sincere respect and appreciation for modders, Wabbajack, MO2 devs, LaughingLeader, MO2-BG3 plugin authors, and everyone else who contributes in small and large ways to enabling the thorough customization of BG3 into an even grander experience. Rolling up my own sleeves to investigate level curves, Player Level Scaling, Combat Extender, and other tweaks or fixes to mods has continued to deepen my appreciation to everyone pioneering the way into the unknown. True cthonauts of Larian and Script Extender code: We thank you, and everyone who contributes their time and talent to the gaming community for free. Zehtuka in particular was a big help in configuring and tweaking Combat Extender for Listonomicon, and learning better practices in mod config management in general. We ask anyone who enjoys Listonomicon to, at a minimum, use MO2’s endorsement features to show their appreciation to mod makers. We appreciate everyone involved in bringing new content to the game, as well as the facilitators of patches, community frameworks, script extenders, native mod loaders, and the hundred other things that are never seen in game but make the magic happen. We also ask that you report issues, crashes, or compatibility problems to us first! Individual mod makers probably do not want a flood of bug reports that may or may not be related to their mod or the hundreds of others in the list :)

Finally, a big “Thank you!” to the cthnonauts who volunteered to struggle with us through the many updates, hotfixes, community polls, tests, and revisions to reach Listonomicon 1.0. You helped us with everything from improving this documentation, to how we present Listo info, mod configurations, difficulty tweaks, new mods to include, and a better path to 1.0 and beyond than we would have found without you. Some of you spent hours diagnosing multiplayer issues, or figuring out why heads were missing in character creation, and gave us the confidence to keep going after an exhausted v0.9 release. 1.0 would not be released with confidence without the help, support, fun, memes, screenshots, complaints, suggestions, testing, and love of the BYC community.

## **What is it Not?**
Listonomicon aims to achieve a seamless feel from a vanilla first playthrough, to an enhanced second playthrough premium experience. This means that Listonomicon will not include:

- Gratuitous adult content frameworks or mods.

- A “Kitchen Sink” compilation. Every mod inclusion is carefully considered for how it is expected to contribute to or disrupt the overall gameplay experience.

- Classes, subclasses, races, feats, spells, magic items, or other options that are out of place. You should only see content that feels like something you might find in BG3 normally - or, at most, something that is within the realm of a creative Dungeon Master who loves buying Kobold Press, Pathfinder, OSR, and other high-quality, setting-agnostic books.

- Cheats, tutorial chests full of goodies, or an easier game. If anything, Listonomicon should feel more difficult and harder to predict than the vanilla game, if you play according to the guide (customized difficulty on Listonomicon settings, 6 party limit or smaller).

- The intention to please everyone. This list is assembled according to our taste and vision. Fortunately, adding or removing mods from MO2 is pretty easy - feel free to use Listonomicon as a baseline, and then void any support on our Discord if you decide to customize!

- A list to play in “Honour Mode.” The features of Honour Mode (such as enhanced bosses, smarter enemies, and tweaked game mechanics) are enabled in this list, without asking players to restrict themselves to a single save in a heavily modded environment.

- An intentionally punishing, grueling, unfair, unfun experience. Listonomicon should feel fresh, exciting, and challenging with many unexpected, changed, or completely new encounters - but it should not feel like an angry DM is dumping an impossible stat block on you at every turn and denying the fun of sword and sorcery fantasy.

## **Customizing the List**
No support is offered or guaranteed for anyone who modifies the behavior or contents of Listonomicon. It is already difficult to keep up with new mods daily on the Nexus; updates and changes to mods in the list; changes in the script extender; new and changed features in the community compatibility frameworks; as well as game patches and hotfixes; vanilla game bugs; and the consequences of (seemingly) minor mod setting tweaks on gameplay. Further modify the list at your own peril. We hope that you are able to customize a fun, stable, great experience tailored to your specific tastes using Listonomicon as a stepping stone - but will not offer troubleshooting or technical support. There is a number of "Optional" mods included in Listo for players who want certain QoL or challenge features where we will try to help, but do not endorse that the end result will be balanced or fun or sane! If you are customizing the list and trying to play multiplayer, please be aware that your mod list, including the exact order mods are in, MUST be the same as all COOP friends. Otherwise MP will break. In fact many things break BG3 MP so you will need to do a lot of troubleshooting.

## **How do I Get Help?**
1.) Make sure to look at the installation guide and **follow in order**. Make sure you have a fresh install of Baldur's Gate 3, launched vanilla via Steam at least once, and nuked %appdata%/local/larian studios to wipe out any non-Listo mod files you may have. Try using the dx11 and the Vulkan version of the game.

2.) The next step would be to check our FAQ

3.) If your issue is not in the FAQ or Installation Guide, take the time to look around Listo's documentation (Especially if it's a gameplay related questions). Major changes to classes and game mechanics have been explained, including links to the relevant mods.

4.) If your question is unanswered in our documentation, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/43EhRjU). Please look through #listo-help and #listo-bug-reports, in addition to looking through pins, announcements, and using the search function.

5.) If after your searches you still cannot find your issue, make a help post in #listo-help on our discord and we will get to it as soon as possible!

## DO NOT ASK USERS IN THE BALDUR'S GATE 3 OR OTHER DISCORDS FOR HELP

Please source all help to our discord alone. Even if you think that your question relates to your installation of Baldur's Gate 3 itself, please bring it into our discord. The authors of the many, many mods of Listonomicon do not want to diagnose problems in a list this large.
