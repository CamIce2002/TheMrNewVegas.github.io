# Listonomicon
![Listonom](https://github.com/TheMrNewVegas/TheMrNewVegas.github.io/assets/112358568/79d370ba-80b8-40ce-b610-b901cb0b5ae3)

## **What is Listonomicon?**
The goal of the “Listonomicon” is to be an out-of-the-box experience that enhances Baldurs Gate 3’s UI, quality of life, and replay value; introduces beloved aspects of the tabletop game’s past and present; and widens and deepens the game mechanics while respecting Larian’s vision for adapting DnD5e to an enjoyable cRPG. If you have questions, want to give feedback to the list curators, or run into trouble, please find ajax and LillyBird in Boneyard Creations. If you face issues with the list, ask us first before bothering Wabbajack help or the creators of the many, many mods in Listonomicon.

## **What is it Not?**
Listonomicon aims to achieve a seamless feel from a vanilla first playthrough, to an enhanced second playthrough premium experience. This means that Listonomicon will not include:

Gratuitous adult content frameworks or mods.
A “Kitchen Sink” compilation. Every mod inclusion is carefully considered for how it is expected to contribute to or disrupt the overall gameplay experience.
Classes, subclasses, races, feats, spells, magic items, or other options that are out of place. You should only see content that feels like something you might find in BG3 normally - or, at most, something that is within the realm of a creative Dungeon Master who loves buying Kobold Press, Pathfinder, and OSR books.
Cheats, tutorial chests full of goodies, or an easier game. If anything, Listonomicon should feel more difficult and harder to predict than the vanilla game, if you play according to the guide (tactician difficulty, 6 party limit).
The intention to please everyone. This list is assembled according to our taste and vision. Fortunately, adding or removing mods from MO2 is pretty easy - feel free to use Listonomicon as a baseline, and then void any support on our Discord if you decide to customize!
A list to play in “Honour Mode.” The features of Honour Mode (such as enhanced bosses, smarter enemies, and tweaked game mechanics) are enabled in this list, without asking players to restrict themselves to a single save in a heavily modded environment.
