# **Installation Guide**
:::info
## **Requirements**
- ~ 20 GB of Space For the Modlist, 150 GB of Space for Baldur's Gate 3
- A Legally Obtained Copy of Baldur's Gate 3 (While a Steam Global Copy is Safest, Any Copy Should Do)
- [Wabbajack](https://www.wabbajack.org/)
- A Nexus Account (Premium Recommended; Drastically Increases Install Speed)
:::

### 1.) Reinstall Baldur's Gate 3

- Nuke BG3. I would recommend uninstalling the game completely, deleting anything left of the install folder, and deleting the contents of %appdata%\Local\Larian Studios. This is to ensure no errant files are leftover from previous playthroughs. Without Mod Organizer 2 (MO2), the BG3 mod manager and modding process makes edits to your install folder and adds files in places that won’t be caught in an uninstall. Nuking everything improves the odds that Listo works as expected.
- Also ensure that your new Baldur's Gate 3 is in a steam folder on the base of your drive (IE: C:/Steam/.../BaldursGate3)

### 2.) Manually Downloading the List

- You can manually grab a copy of Listonomicon [here](https://github.com/Listonomicon-Team/Listonomicon) (under “Releases” on the right side) and use Wabba’s “Install from disk,” or you can search the unofficial gallery for Listonomicon and download that way.

### 3.) Downloading the list from the Gallery

- If you do not want to download manually, install Listonomicon through Wabbajack as normal. The download icon will be replaced with a play icon, on the next page you can choose an install location. Make sure to install the list to somewhere that is not in a protected folder (such as Downloads) and not inside your Baldur’s Gate 3 install. For example, I install to H:\Games\Listonomicon, with mods downloaded to H:\Games\Listonomicon\downloads. If you want to install manually from a Github distro, navigate back to the landing page of Wabbajack and choose “Install From Disk.” 

### 4.) Download the [Script Extender](https://github.com/Norbyte/bg3se/releases) and install to [game install path]\Baldurs Gate 3\bin.

### 5.) Finalizing Mod List Settings

- Once the modlist download has completed, navigate to where you downloaded your Listonomicon (e.g. H:\Listonomicon\downloads) and find “zzz_ListonomiconModSettings.” Open the zip file and copy/paste its contents to %AppData%\Local\Larian Studios\Baldur's Gate 3\Script Extender (create the Script Extender folder if it does not exist).

### 6.) Preparing Steam

- Navigate to Steam -> Right click BG3 -> Properties -> Updates and change “Automatic Updates” to “Only Update This Game When I Launch It.”
- Never launch the game via Steam, always launch it through Mod Organizer, to prevent updates from breaking the list and ending your playthrough.
- You may wish to disable cloud backup of save data, as well. Whichever patch/hotfix you start your playthrough, you should stay on until the end of your playthrough!

:::caution
BG3 is still receiving Patches (major updates) and Hotfixes (small updates). These updates tend to introduce new bugs and issues to the game that may be difficult to distinguish from issues caused by mods (either with the list, or mods broken by updates). Major updates can also break Script Extender functionality, etc etc.
