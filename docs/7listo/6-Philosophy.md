This self-aggrandizing page summarizes the mission statement, purpose, goals, and intent of Listonomicon. The tl;dr is that we really enjoyed playing BG3, and wanted to add more on top of it, fix bugs, and make QoL tweaks. LillyBird and I do not see a reason to dramatically change the game or add scoops of foreign content. We just want more BG3.

## Classes and Subclasses

Classes and Subclasses should represent something that exists in official D&D material or high-quality, setting-agnostic third party publications, makes sense in the Forgotten Realms (sorry my fellow DragonMech and Dragonstar fans), and compliments Larian’s design. It must work within the Compatibility Framework, and it must have level scaling to 20. Anything that requires unusual deviation or disruption to the regular flow of gameplay, such as a class that introduces an obnoxious number of toggle abilities or changes to the action economy or impacts the basic features of other classes, will most likely not be considered for inclusion. Classes and subclasses should follow their book/tabletop counterparts as closely as practical, with minimal changes to translate to the game.

## Magic Weapons, Armor, and Items

New gear should reasonably exist in the Forgotten Realms. The design philosophy and distribution (as static loot, or new random loot table entries or shopkeeper inventory) should match Larian’s progression expectations and design sensibility. Vanilla gear that is changed should avoid “over tuning” and changes should focus on making items more interesting, under-used items more compelling, or provide Quality of Life changes to awkward mechanics or descriptions.

## Feats, Class Features, and Progression

New feats should add interesting options. Revised feats (nerfed or buffed or just tweaked) should prevent any options from feeling mandatory, polarizing, or weak. The progression of feats every 3 levels, instead of 4, allows more feats to be chosen over the course of the game; allows builds to come together sooner (such as polearm/sentinel tanks); and it allows multi-class dips to grab their 3rd level subclass features without having to choose a 4th level or miss a feat. Level progression should be faster than the base game, allowing players who do most content to reach level 15+ and completionists to reach level 18+. New classes/subclasses must scale to level 20.

## Engaging Combat and Difficulty Curve

Enemy casters should have access to 5e spells and Homebrew spells. Enemies are smarter, and more viscous: They will target unconscious characters, attempt to shove or throw characters off cliffs and into chasms, and in general feel like they are trying just as hard to survive an encounter as the player is. The list enables Honour Mode mechanics, including legendary actions added to boss fights. And with Combat Extender, many enemies and bosses have been given direct upgrades to enhance the challenge.

## Multiplayer Compatibility

There is no promise that coop will never be sacrificed due to a future mod being incompatible, but too compelling to leave out of Listo. But for the time being, Listo remains functional for a full, fun, multiplayer experience.

## A Platform to Enable Your Fun

At the end of the day, Listo's goal is to give you even more BG3. But you may disagree with how we do that, the mod settings we use, and what mods we choose to use or exclude. That's fine :) While we do not promise any help or support, you are encouraged to explore making your own Wabbajack List if you think you can do better. In fact, you are welcome to use Listonomicon as a baseline and make your tweaks from there, including copying any mod settings or Listo's heavily customized Combat Extender config. Please read our [mod identification tracker notes](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_dZdM_16xeE4yIqKYyk7HMjLI3WW7PhfpdlrKHM4vyg/edit?usp=sharing) to get an understanding of our choices, what mods we have tested, and why Listo is the way it is - it will be easier to make something better if you can skip repeating the same mistakes we did!

## Have suggestions to make Listonomicon better?

The easiest way to get in touch with us is to [join our Discord](https://discord.gg/boneyard-creations-415287319982112768). Make sure to grab the @Listonomicon role, and then post your suggestions in #listo-suggestions. Familiarize yourself with the list's philosophy before suggesting things that will be categorically denied (such as classes that lack level 20 progression, anime katanas, or mechs).
