# Character Creation

## Tav, Durge, and Dream Visitor Customization Notes

- Listonomicon offers many new custom head meshes, which can (and many times do) conflict with new piercings and hairstyles. Specifically, piercings and hairstyles that try to apply physics can be wonky - this is not the fault of the cosmetic mod makers, and it is not really within the power of Listo to fix these conflicts.
- If your Character Creation menu has several entries that say "Not Found" and result in invisible or un-textured body parts and hair, please let Ajax know. He is aware of some Vexa dragonborn head issues already but at this time there are no known issues for any other race.
- The "Randomize" button works again in Listo. However if you are going to rely on a random appearance, please still do a Q/C check of your character! Make sure randomize did not give your character nails if they should not have any, otherwise you will get in game and find out you have claws floating 2 feet off your body. Double check if you were assigned a tail if that is not something you want. Etc. Randomize is fun but it can result in a lot of wonky choices!

## Changes to Class Features, Feats, Progression, Challenge and Leveling Notes
	
Listonomicon progression features feats every 3 class levels. This means ASIs and feat selection will happen at class level 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 (not 4, 8, 12, etc). You will be able to squeeze one additional feat into your career (6 total), and multiclass dips can stop at 3 or 6 without missing a feat/ASI. Fighters/Rogues earn an extra feat at level 11.

The level scale goes all the way to 20, with all classes and subclasses able to be played 1-20 or mixed with multiclassing.

The XP curve of Listonomicon is customized. Theoretically, by default BG3 requires about 365,000 XP to achieve level 20, and 100,000 XP to achieve level 12. Achieving level 20 in Listonomicon requires (total) 383,917 XP. There is much more than 380k XP available in the game for completionist players, but even players who only play the story and major side quests while skipping many optional encounters and small quests can expect to reach level 16+ in Act 3. 
Listo’s level curve is a little strange. Levels 1-3 are very fast; so fast in fact, that you should already by level 3 at the end of the tutorial imp fight. The road to level 6 is quick, and will be completed by the time you 100% “The Beach” (Grove storyline, gnolls, zhent, etc - everything before Underdark and before Creche). Progression around level 10 is closer to vanilla, then steadily slows down on the way to level 20. Keep in mind that the overall experience will most likely still be faster than vanilla BG3, due to [Encounters Overhaul adding more Act 1 and Act 2 encounters](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/7740?tab=description). Valkrana's Skeletal Encounters add more opportunity for XP, and optional Listo mods like Many More Enemies and Trash Mobs will add even more.

More specific information regarding new and changed classes, subclasses, and class features can be found on a later page. But this summary provides an overview of some of the most impactful changes from vanilla:

- Totemic barbarians (“Wildheart” in BG3) are now more dynamic, with the ability to [shift between totemic animal benefits when they rage or during rages](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/8274?tab=description). In addition, [Reckless Attack is a toggled feature](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/10924) rather than something chosen at the time of attacking (or time of missing).
- Rogues now receive a “[Smart Cunning Action](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/8906?tab=description)” that functions much closer to the rulebooks. As a bonus, the improved bonus action is extended to monks and rangers where appropriate.
- Circle of Spore Druids have [more variety in their, well, spores](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/11252?tab=description). In addition, they gain [extra attack at 5th level](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/4018?tab=description) (does not stack with extra attack from any other class). All druids benefit from [QoL features reducing the number of incompatibilities between wild shape, and benefiting from magic items or spellcasting](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/3214).
- Illithid Powers are [significantly revamped](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/5105?tab=files).
- Wild Magic Sorcerers have an [incremental chance of triggering a surge](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/9603), and the [list of possible wild magic surges](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/2967) is much larger.
