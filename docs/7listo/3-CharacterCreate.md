# Character Creation

## Tav, Durge, and Dream Visitor Customization Notes

:::warning 
Do not hit “Randomize Appearance.” It will result in a CTD :)
::: 

- Listonomicon offers many new custom head meshes, makeup options, colors, tones, piercings, and hairstyles. While each of these mods are the hard work of mod makers, they were not all designed to work together - many combinations will suffer from clipping, and other issues.
- These are not issues that can be fixed by changing Listonomicon, nor are they issues that mod makers are likely to rush to address. Many piercings will not look correct on short races, orcs, or dragonborn; and hair will not be in the correct place.
- Visual effects, like those for Speak With Dead, are assigned according to a file that is not natively dynamic. This means that for many heads added by mods and vanilla heads to all have working VFX, community framework mod solutions are required.
- - Listonomicon is testing a patch tool that offers to extend working VFX to all heads in races.lsx, but please report if this is not working for you.

## Class, Feats, Features, and Leveling Notes
	
- Listonomicon progression features feats every 3 class levels. This means ASIs and feat selection will happen at class level 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 (not 4, 8, 12, etc).
- You will be able to squeeze one additional feat into your career, and multiclass dips can stop at 3 or 6 without missing a feat/ASI.
- The level scale goes all the way to 20, with all classes and subclasses able to be played 1-20 or mixed with multiclassing. Check [UnlockLevelCurve notes](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/377) as not all base game classes have been updated equally, and not all spells are able to take advantage of higher level spell slots.

- The XP curve of Listonomicon is customized. UnlockLevelCurve, by default, requires about 365,000 XP to achieve level 20, and base BG3 requires 100,000 XP to achieve level 12.
- Achieving level 20 in Listonomicon requires (total) 273,404 XP. There is much more than 273k XP available in the game for completionist players, but even players who only play the story and major side quests while skipping many optional encounters and small quests can expect to reach level 17+ in Act 3.
- The leveling scale is not just extended to 20, it is also accelerated - with the goal being a “1.5x speed” experience. In addition, many enemies will be encountered at a higher level; their increased HP, stats, and spells are compensated with increased XP.

- Note that levels 1-5 do not follow the semi-linear progression curve; the intent is to leave the Nautiloid and land on the beach already at level 5. This should help avoid some (very) early game suffering, encourage build variety, and enable multiclassing or essential feat selection sooner.

- Totemic barbarians (“Wildheart” in BG3) are now more dynamic, with the [ability to shift between totemic animal benefits](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/8274) when they rage or during rages.
