## Magic Items and Upgrading

- Listonomicon incorporates mods that change, rebalance, or improve many vanilla magic items. Many magic items locked to good or evil playthroughs have been redistributed, providing alternate sources or opportunities to get valuable items that might otherwise be missed. Check your vendors frequently! An almost-completely-randomized distribution of 431 magic items can be enabled via Random Equipment Loot (look in the optional mods notes).
- Furthermore, [Phalar Aluve](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/2987?tab=description) has its own upgrade path. There is a music box hidden in Act 2 and Act 3. You can find the location on the mod’s Nexus page, but it is intended to be a hidden/secret reward! The Titanstring Bow has received multiple variations, which can be found hidden around the game.
- Finally, the list is also full of new magic items. Some items exist as static loot, intentionally placed somewhere in the world; added to a specific chest or quest reward; or will be found on the bodies of bosses.
- Overall, you should feel encouraged to change your equipment more frequently than the vanilla game, with fewer “best in slot” choices and with fewer magic items that feel like nothing but Gale food.
- Elixirs have been changed, according to [Elixirs Revised](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/10073). Please read the mod page and pay closer attention to the description of elixirs in-game, as many of them now stack or work differently.

## Inventory Management & QoL

- “[WiFi Potions](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/5080)” changes the way healing potions are managed. You no longer need to worry about splitting stacks and distributing them throughout your team. You should have a single “WiFi Potion” for each healing potion type to place on your hotbar, which will access a corresponding potion from anywhere in your party. Just like magic keys from another character’s pocket!
- [Automatic Loot Seller v3](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/2435) adds a new bag to your inventory. Its primary function is to automatically set any/all junk added to your inventory to “Add to Wares” status, letting you distinguish vendor trash items and sell them quickly. Dragging items from your inventory onto the bag will mark them as junk, as well, and may make all future copies of that item junk - so be careful! True junk as well as vendor sale only items (such as paintings, silver plates, and gems) will be marked. Non-quest-related books will automatically be marked as ware after being read.
- Food will be automatically sent to your camp chest when looted or purchased.

## Shopping, Merchants, Withers

Withers is now a merchant! Press the trade button at the bottom-left when talking to him. Dyes and camp clothes have been moved off of normal vendors and to Withers, reducing the ridiculous amount of clutter otherwise on each merchant. Withers will also sell food. He has 50,000 gold, making him the most convenient place to dump your trash pile.

## Multiplayer Compatiblity

While somewhat niche, an advantage to using a curated list is easy mod list sharing between players, which should make cooperative play easy. Please note that many mods are not believed to affect multiplayer (such as UI replacers), and some may affect multiplayer in unexpected ways. Maintaining multiplayer compatibility is a tertiary goal of Listonomicon. There may be mods in the future that break COOP, but are so compelling that we sacrifice COOP for the best single player experience. We would like Listonomicon to be a COOP ready package, however, and will include basic instructions for what to enable/disable.

:::warning
Currently, it appears that custom classes/subclasses cause an issue with multiplayer games being able to start correctly. All players must pick a vanilla class/subclass during the tutorial, and will have to wait until Withers is unlocked to respec. Coop with more than 4 players is not supported.
