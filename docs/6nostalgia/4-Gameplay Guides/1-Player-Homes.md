**[Afterschool Special](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/43757)**

Afterschool Special is a fully voiced quest mod based on my original Schoolhouse Base for Fallout New Vegas. Many people who enjoyed my Schoolhouse Base mod requested that I create a quest version so the player can actually work for and earn their new home, so this is the culmination of that request. Overall, the mod is a quest to complete a makeover of the the Schoolhouse in Goodsprings that includes a Computerized Inventory Management System [CIMS] giving the player a fully functional and follower friendly base of operations for your adventures in the Mojave!
