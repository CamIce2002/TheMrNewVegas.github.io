NO LONGER SUPPORTED, DO THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK, TOO MANY BUGS

1.) Create a mod inside of the Modpack Resources separator called “[No Delete] NVR” by right clicking the separator, then navigating to All Mods>Create Empty Mod Inside

2.) To install NVR, begin by going to the [TES Reloaded Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/QgN6mR6eTK). Go to the #nightly-builds channel to find the NewVegasReloaded.zip file shown in the image. (IF YOU DON'T THEN YOUR GAME WILL LOOK BAD). Once downloaded, extract all of the files located in the archive folder to the NVR mod you created under the Modpack Resources separator by right clicking it and opening in explorer.

3.) Go to this link in the [#preset-share channel of the TES Reloaded discord](https://discord.com/channels/344843935123898369/1030630380455350272/1077380480283983973) and download A Raven of Many Hats preset.

4.) Take this file (NewVegasRoladed.dll.config) and in your NVR mod, overwrite the same file. This should be located in NVR>NVSE>Plugins

5.) Enable the mod in MO2 & Launch the game. Should work from here!

Notice: If you try to use an older preset on a newer version of NVR, you will experience crashes and break your NVR. Please be aware of the presets you decide to use and what version of NVR you are on (As of the posting of this guide, the listed preset should work with the current version of NVR)
