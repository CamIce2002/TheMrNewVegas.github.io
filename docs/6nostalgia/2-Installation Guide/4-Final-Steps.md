**Post-Wabbajack Installation & MO2 Setup**

* When the Wabbajack installation has completed, go to the folder you made

* Open ModOrganizer

* Since your directories may not match mine, you may need to set them up yourself. Go to Edit and make sure the Nostalgia directory is in the Stock Game folder pointing to the FalloutNV.exe

* Run the launcher to generate ini's

* Close launcher

* Go to your Nostalgia Folder

* Go to Nostalgia/Game Folder Files

* Copy the two save files found there

* Go back to the main directory, then to the profiles folder

* Go into Nostalgia/saves (if it isn't there then make a saves folder) and paste the files inside

* After doing this your game should run smoothly! Run Nostalgia through MO2. You will likely receive a popup asking you would like to clear a read only flag. Make sure you choose “Clear Read Only Flag”.

* When in game be sure to press INS and familiarize yourself with the controls! (Controller Overlay coming soon!)

Congratulations! Your game should be up and running smoothly. If you are having any issues, please re-read the guide before coming to the Discord for help. There's a help channel set up for questions and problems. Please also check the sidebar for Gameplay Guides and more information.
