<p><strong><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/83291" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Haunted Casino</a></strong></p>
<p>Venture beyond the New Vegas Strip into the ruins that were left behind and forgotten to discover a haunting adventure with plenty of spooks and frights. Discover the derelict remains of Gally&#x27;s Hotel &amp; Casino, while you search for a ghost hunter who got lost inside. Just hope you don&#x27;t come across any darker spirits during your investigation. It might do you some good to bring a gun or two, just in case.</p>
<p>To begin the quest, listen to the Ghost Files Radio Broadcast on your Pip-Boy and follow the instructions.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s recommended that you take it slowly when exploring the casino. You never know what you might miss by sprinting through everything.
Recommended level is 15+. You <em>could</em> do it at lower levels, but it might be a bit painful.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/82052" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The World We Knew</a></strong></p>
<p>In a forgotten part of Nevada where a landlill hides the earth lies hidden a strange vault,
destitute of its inhabitants but instead filled with all manner of creatures.
Your role in this mod is to make your way through this vault and close its unresolved past,
all while fighting varying enemy types, solve puzzles and walk through sometimes maze like interiors.</p>
<p>Beside the main story of the vault there is plenty of backstory,
ranging from terminal logs to scattered notes, but also the tale of the Gooseman,
Interesting unique collectibles which lead to an ultimate bonus room.</p>
<p>Once you enter the vault, you can only exit by finishing the quest.
therefore it is recommended to bring plenty of ammunition and healing items.
In the vault there ought to be plenty of oppertunities to loot te restore the used supplies.
About a dozen new weapons and apparel with custom texture or mesh have been added which can used if all else fails.
Starting level is up to player, but I recommend from 20 or higher.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/81385" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Into The Deep</a></strong></p>
<p>Overview
A small community southwest of Nipton has accidentally blown their way into a long hidden away vault. After heading inside they found themselves trapped and are now in need of your help to get out.</p>
<p>There are two a fully marked quests, (one being smaller), with several boss fights, all of which are avoidable with alternative skills. This mod includes a lot of custom assets such as; new armors, new enemies, new textures, a new consumable, new perks, a small companion and a unique weapon. I tried to make this challenging for every level but it is up to you to decide whether I succeeded or not.</p>
<p>I was inspired by the older fallout games in lore and creation. Exploring is not only interesting but can yield important loot that might aid you as you go deeper into the facility. To find the ultimate price one must search well. I always found the vaults very creepy by nature, and this is my attempt at creating my very own creepy vault. The mod has elements of horror but no jumpscares.</p>
<p>This is an open ended quest, where every character can die! Should that happen the outcome of the quest will change.</p>
<p>There is a Cheat Sheet available in the Miscellaneous section of the downloads. This text file explains how to complete every quest and find every secret.</p>
<p>How to start the mod
To start the quest simply go to the town called Shamble southwest of Nipton and talk to the man named Tempeh. He stays inside the smaller of the two shacks. From there the quest markers will guide the way.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/83590" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Caravan Guard - Remastered</a></strong></p>
<p>Title says all: this mod allows you to be a caravan guard. And if you&#x27;re not into fighting... Well somebody has to clean brahmin excrements.</p>
<p>Basically this mod adds new caravan company located near NCR sharecropper farms, just go there and ask for a job. If you&#x27;ll pass the skill check you&#x27;ll become a caravan guard.</p>
<p>This maybe isn&#x27;t a great adventure, but a repeatable job with decent payment. How much? Well. it depends... dead brahmin=smaller payment. As a more experienced guard you&#x27;ll get paid well and get an unique caravan shotgun.</p>
<p>Caravan routes:</p>
<p>Grizzly Caravans -&gt; 188 Trading Post -&gt; Novac -&gt; Mojave Outpost
Mojave Outpost -&gt; Novac -&gt; 188 Trading Post -&gt; Grizzly Caravans</p>
<p>Grizzly Caravans -&gt; Sloan -&gt; Mojave Outpost
Mojave Outpost -&gt; Sloan -&gt; Grizzly Caravans</p>
<p>You don&#x27;t have to guard the caravan whole route. You get paid on every stop and you can resign whenever you want!</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/78427" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New Vegas Killer LE</a></strong></p>
<p>New Vegas Killer features a zany, compact questline that is geared towards players with bad karma. Specifically, it offers a questline based on the premise that the player has joined Judge Richter at the conclusion of New Vegas Bounties. It is not an official addition to my quest mod series, but is merely the equivalent of a What If? spinoff.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/77108" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New Vegas Bounties I LE</a></strong></p>
<p>The first installment in a series for Fallout: New Vegas. Upon initiating the quest, you&#x27;ll be tasked with tracking down the most malevolent and vile assortment of outlaws in the Mojave Wasteland.</p>
<p>Your targets will include rogue rangers, fiends, raiders, drug smugglers, cannibals, and pistoleros, to name a few. Your opponents are all designed to be boss-caliber, akin to the fiends in &quot;Three-Card Bounty&quot;, and become gradually more difficult as you progress.</p>
<p>At its core, New Vegas Bounties is an action mod; extreme violence and profanity are ubiquitous. In lieu of mind-boggling puzzles or &quot;go collect x or y resource&quot;-type quests, you will be confronted with dangerous opponents who are designed to frustrate and kill you. You will be harried, ambushed, outnumbered, and outgunned. This is the path of a bounty hunter - take it or leave it.</p>
<p>New Vegas Bounties also offers erudite conversations with your boss, Randall as well as interesting choices involving skills and perks with your adversaries.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/75196" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Claim the Mojave</a></strong></p>
<p>A gold sink mod designed around allowing the player to spend caps to build outposts at locations in the Mojave for the faction of their choice. Designed for use alongside FPGE and TLD. Includes a TTW addon to claim locations in the Capital Wasteland.</p>
<p>==Starting the Mod==
The main hub for this mod is an Abandoned Army Bunker found in a narrow canyon north of Spring Mt. Ranch State Park and South of Red Rock Canyon. Once you find the key card that lets you into the bunker (or if you have a high enough science skill, bypass the security panel) and restart the bunker’s generators, you can claim the bunker for the faction of your choice. You can also rename the bunker whatever you want using a text input menu.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/49012" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Inheritance</a></strong></p>
<p>Having learned of the Courier&#x27;s exploits, a dying man contacts the player in hopes of employing him/her to deliver a mysterious package. Upon accepting the job, the Courier will soon find himself/herself making unwilling allies and dangerous enemies, all jockeying to claim the same prize.</p>
<p>The Inheritance is a compact, lore-friendly quest mod for Fallout: New Vegas, designed to offer new avenues to experience combat and role-playing for high-level characters. It offers a challenging primary quest that is followed by a collection of small sidequests, all dependent on the player&#x27;s actions. While all of these quests include the trademark ultra-violence and profanity found in my past mods, some of the content departs from New Vegas Bounties in tone and style, as some quests are more dependent on finesse instead of aggression. A detailed description of prerequisites for each sidequest is included in the readme. This mod began as a series of scripting experiments for another project, The Siege of Firebase Zulu, therefore some of the sidequests are wholly unrelated to the primary quest. Nonetheless, I believe players appreciate fresh content, so I elected to include these missions.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/46907" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beyond Boulder Dome</a></strong></p>
<p>The Boulder Dome was constructed before the war to be a &quot;city of the future&quot;; a prototype for future cities on the moon and other planets. It was also an advanced scientific research facility, and an Ark of sorts, built to withstand severe nuclear attacks. And withstand it did.</p>
<p>Mere hours before the bombs dropped, only the elite of society, or those with specialist skills; the top of their fields, were transported to the Dome and transported two hundred years into the future. Put into a &quot;cold sleep&quot;, they would ride out the war and the following chaos, to start a new world in the future.</p>
<p>When the scientists woke up, they found themselves in a nightmare. Their bodies now riddled with a strange disease of unknown origin, dubbed the Seltsam Syndrome; literally meaning &quot;strange disease&quot;. Forced to wear advanced Bio-suits, to help slow the spread, they struggle to survive, as time is running out.</p>
<p>Beyond the Dome, outside the highly toxic ruins of Boulder, two factions are moving in.</p>
<p>The NCR has a deadly and unmerciful mission, to stop the spread of the Seltsam Syndrome by eliminating all potential carriers. They have tracked the disease to its last known vestige, The Boulder Dome itself.</p>
<p>The Colorado branch of the Brotherhood of Steel have also set their sights on the Dome. Its leader seeks to control the Dome for the good of the region, he claims, to bring peace to the chaos. Very close to a real, working cure for the Seltsam Syndrome, he offers a seemingly peaceful solution.</p>
<p>Forced into the middle of things, is a simple courier, far from home. The decisions of the courier may slide the balance in many different ways, ultimately determining the fate of the scientists of The Boulder Dome.</p>
<p>Colorado is a place with many secrets and surprises. Three new worldspaces. New unique weapons and armor, new creatures never before seen with custom sounds, new robots. 50+ fully voiced and lip-synced characters. A long main quest with multiple pathways, and many side-quests should provide many hours of gameplay.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/58488" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Boom to the Moon</a></strong></p>
<p>Boom to the Moon follows the adventures of Anaximander (you can call him &quot;Max&quot;), a young man who needs help finding out what has happened to his wife. There may be a rocket and spacesuits involved. Things will probably balloon from there.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/60208" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Legion Quests Expanded</a></strong></p>
<p>The quests That Lucky Old Sun (HELIOS One), Birds of a Feather (Van Graffs), How Little We Know (Omertas), and We Are Legion (taking over Forlorn Hope) are altered, to either expand them or provide an option to complete the quest in favor of the Legion.</p>
<p>Two new Legion quests are added:
One involves meeting up with Cato Hostilius to assassinate Chief Hanlon, the leader of the Rangers.
The other is a side-quest that involves taking down the various Ranger Stations. The player also receives a Legion Support Radio that can be used to call in Legionaries as followers that assist you in combat.</p>
<p>Three quests have been added into the main Legion questline, occurring after the Boomers part and before the White Gloves part of Render unto Caesar, i.e.:</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/80004" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Five-Card Ante - A Legion Quest Mod</a></strong></p>
<p>I&#x27;ve always thought the Samson Rock Crushing Plant was under-utilised in Vanilla New Vegas, and would be a great spot for a Bait-And-Switch type of trap to kill First Recon when you enlist their help to kill Driver Nephi.</p>
<p>This mod doesn&#x27;t preclude the ability of the player to complete Three-Card Bounty; the deaths of First Recon are completely immaterial to actually completing that quest. So you can do both; complete Three-Card Bounty, and complete Five-Card Ante (this mod).</p>
<p>Note: This mod is completely unvoiced, so use xVASynth yourself to generate audio and their corresponding <code>.lip</code> files if you want them to have voices. I&#x27;m considering implementing AI voice generation in the future via ElevenLabs.</p>
<p>How To Start The Quest
Outside Camp McCarran, there will be an NPC named &quot;Disguised Frumentarius&quot; walking around in front of the El Rey Motel. Either be accepted with the Legion, or talk to Major Dhatri at least once, and he&#x27;ll offer you the quest.</p>

<p>Job Boards/Terminals:
Job boards and terminals can be found in almost every settlement in the Wasteland. These are the point of contact with the opportunities presented by this mod. Each job board/terminal represents the settlement it is located in, each one offers a different selection of quests with objectives based on the settlement&#x27;s relations to other factions.</p>
<p>Quest Rewards:
For now, you will only be rewarded with XP, caps, and fame. XP rewarded is dynamically generated based the what the quest requires you to do. The amount of caps rewarded is based on the level you are and what quest you&#x27;re doing, additionally, a heightened barter skill will increase the amount of caps you get per quest. The fame gain from these quests are quite meager, but are a good way of building up reputation for factions that don&#x27;t offer much in regards of fame gain. Completing these quests in succession has a high chance to yield great experience and monetary gains.</p>
<p>Quest Limit:
The recycling of quests is what makes this mod tick! Whenever you finish one of the quests, it gets added into a pool of inactive quests so it can be assigned totally different objectives in the future. In terms of limit, you are currently limited to 100 radiant quests. No, I will not increase this because there is no reason for you to have 100 active quests... ever.</p>
<p>Multiple Quest types:
Delivery: Deliver packages to the people of the Wasteland! These quests won&#x27;t have you trekking across the Wasteland to make a simple parcel delivery, the package recipient is chosen based on their distance from the assigning job board and their relations to the faction the board belongs to. Quest rewards and XP are determined by the distance between the starting location and the Package Recipient.</p>
<p>Delivery (Mojave Express): Unlike your standard Delivery job, the Mojave Express counterpart doesn&#x27;t see distance or faction relations as a means to an end. These missions will have you hiking across the Wasteland, delivering to any character in need of Courier 6&#x27;s package.</p>
<p>Exterminate: Cleanse the Wasteland of Irradiated Abominations. These quests involve tracking down multiple creatures within a specific vicinity of the settlement you&#x27;re picking the job up from. These contracts will have you taking on anything from Feral Ghouls to Deathclaws. But don&#x27;t worry, the tougher jobs will only be offered to higher leveled players.</p>
<p>Hunt: Whether it&#x27;s their general nuisance or because people are hungry, the Hunt job exists to serve. This job will have you search for and kill some of the various animals of the Wasteland.</p>
<p>Scavenge: Scavenge quests necessitate the player to locate a specific quantity of a particular miscellaneous item for a given settlement. Sure, these kinds of quests have never been the most fun - but the items you&#x27;re searching for will yield more caps to you than simply selling the same amount in a shop.</p>
<p>Gather: Much like the aforementioned Fetch quest, Gather quests involve the player collecting herbs, plants, and other helpful items from the Wasteland for a settlement.</p>
<p>Kill: Resembling a bounty-esque contract, Kill quests entail hunting down and eliminating an NPC hostile or unfriendly to the hiring settlement. A great addition to players who&#x27;re bloodthirsty and feel like they ran out of things to kill - or - players that are just downright bloodthirsty.</p>
<p>Eliminate: Much like the Kill quest type, Eliminate quests are specifically for singular radioactive abominations, often requiring higher-level players.</p>
