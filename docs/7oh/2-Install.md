## Before you Start
- Make sure that you visit the collection's page **[here](https://next.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kdarktide/collections/rzdfo4)**

- You will need to manually install both [Vortex Mod Manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/) & [Darktide Mod Loader](https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kdarktide/mods/19/?tab=description) for everything to work. Instructions are listed on the mod page and in the Read Me file included in the mod.

- If Vortex doesn't recognize Darktide as a game, go [here](https://github.com/Darktide-Mod-Framework/Darktide-Vortex-Extension) and follow the guide for Vortex.

- Run "toggle modding (patch/unpatch game files)" on the Dashboard tab of Vortex. If it says "Darktide is already patched" then click "No" and continue. If it says "Darktide is now patched" then continue.

## Post-Install

- After you install everything, click Deploy and then play.

- You no longer need to worry about load order due to the Auto Mod Loading and Ordering mod.

##Updating 

- When the game updates, run the "Toggle Modding" tool on the Darktide Dashboard. If it says "Darktide is already patched" then you don't need to patch.

- Check for updates with mods regularly, I have the list set to download the latest versions.

## Known Bugs

- Getting downed during a boss fight will disable the health bar of the boss
