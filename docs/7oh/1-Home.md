## What is Ordo Hereticus?
### [Nexus Collection Link](https://next.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kdarktide/collections/rzdfo4)

Ordo Hereticus is a customizable collection of QoL mods that make the game more streamlined and fun.

## Features

- FullAuto -  This mod works by basically spamming click for you, but in a way that should be more reliable and precise than a macro. It does not actually alter any game play or weapon behavior. Rest assured that this mod falls squarely within Fatshark's modding policy, so you don't have to worry about it being flagged as cheating. Can be disabled if you do not like it.
- Healthbars - Show health bars from the Psykanium in regular game modes, toggleable by enemy class.
- Hub Hotkey Menus -  This mod lets you assign hotkeys for the various menus you can find on  the Mourning Star. For example you can access the Mission Board from  anywhere on the ship by pressing a single key.
- KeepSwinging - Spare your joints - use keybinds to spam light melee attacks for you. You can set a toggle keybind and a held keybind. Can be disabled if you do not like it.
- LoadingLore - This mod will overwrite the default loading screen messages to instead include a bunch of helpful tips sourced from the community. The user can select which kind of tips they'd like to see from the mod menu. The tips cover a lot of basic and not so basic things and there are also a couple of more generic lore bits.
- LogMeIn - Automatically hits space for you at the title screen and automatically selects your current character. Includes a hotkey to cancel the character selections.
- Scoreboard - Shows a scoreboard after missions.
