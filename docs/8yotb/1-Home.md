## What is Year of the Blight?

Year of the Blight is a lightweight, vanilla+ modlist for Dragon Age Origins Ultimate Edition, focusing on keeping the original experience while fixing a variety of bugs and adding lore-friendly improvements to character models, textures, armor, and weapons to keep it in line with what was added in later games in the series.
