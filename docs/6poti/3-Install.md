> Inside the folder, launch openmw-wizard.exe and follow the steps, **unchecking Import Bitmap Fonts Setup from Morrowind** at the Import Settings stage. 

### 3.) Launch your installed Wabbajack & go to the Cogwheel at the top right. Log into your Nexus account through here.

### 4.) If you are installing the list through Wabbajack’s Gallery, go to “Browse Modlists” then search Path of the Incarnate. Click the download icon.

### 5.) Set your modlist installation location to wherever your would like it (IE: C:/Modlists/POTI) & it will automatically create the downloads directory for you. Press the play button when you are done and installation will begin.
