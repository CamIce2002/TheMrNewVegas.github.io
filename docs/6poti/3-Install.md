# **Part 1: Installation Guide**

### 1.) Install a fresh copy of Morrowind GOTY

> If a copy has already been installed, the game can be uninstalled, ini's deleted in User/Documents/My Games/Morrowind, and then reinstalled like normal through Steam or GOG.

> Run the game at least once to the main menu to generate the required fresh ini's.

### 2.) Unzip the OpenMW Development Build into the folder you would like it installed (I.E. C:/Games/OpenMW .49)

> Inside the folder, launch openmw-wizard.exe and follow the steps, **unchecking "Import Bitmap Fonts Setup from Morrowind"** at the Import Settings stage. 

### 3.) Launch your installed Wabbajack & go to the Cogwheel at the top right. Log into your Nexus account through here.

### 4.) If you are installing the list through Wabbajack’s Gallery, go to “Browse Modlists” then search Path of the Incarnate. Click the download icon.

> If you are installing the list using a downloaded .wabba file, then click on "Install from Disk" and set the Target Modlist path to your file.

### 5.) Set your modlist installation location to wherever your would like it (IE: C:/Modlists/POTI) & it will automatically create the downloads directory for you. Press the play button when you are done and installation will begin.

### 6.) After Wabbajack installation is done, make sure in Mod Organizer that the OpenMW application directories in the dropdown menu match the locations on your system. If they do not, change them so that they do.

> Launch ModOrganizer.exe from your POTI folder, navigate to the dropdown menu at the top right, select it, then select "Edit".

> Set the binary path for "Path of the Incarnate" to openmw.exe, and OpenMW Launcher to OpenMW-Launcher.exe, both of which can be found in your chosen OpenMW Development Build installation folder. 

### 7.) You can now select “Path of the Incarnate” from the right hand dropdown in MO2 and press play.
