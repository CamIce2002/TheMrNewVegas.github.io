## **What is Path of the Incarnate?**
Path of the Incarnate is a Wabbajack mod list for OpenMW. It's designed to offer a fresh, stable, and immersive experience for new and old players alike, without polishing off the alien charm that many fans of Morrowind have come to love. From new quests, landmass overhauls & additions, hundreds of new items & NPCs, adjustments to combat & leveling, graphical overhauls, and much more, you'll be able to experience this Bethesda classic with 20+ years of community love, all in an easy-to-install package.

* Graphical Changes:
A large majority of the landscapes, visual effects, world objects, weapons, armor, and anything else you can think of have been completely changed in some form. Whether upscaled, added to, or retextured entirely, you can experience the visuals of Morrowind in a new light.

* New Weapons, Armor, & Clothing: 
A host of new weapons, armors, and clothing pieces adorn both the NPC's and fill the world. These all breathe new life into the game, creating both diversity to NPC's and new play-styles for the player.

* New Quests, Jobs, & Adventures:
Many new quest mods have been added to Morrowind. Whether full fledged adventures, new occupations for you to partake in, or small additions throughout the world, countless hours of content lay ahead. Notably, [Tamriel Rebuilt](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42145), [Project Cyrodiil](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44922), and [Skyrim Home of the Nords](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44921) are included for those who wish to venture beyond Vvardenfell's shores.

* Gameplay:
Adjustments have been made to Morrowind's combat, leveling system, and other gameplay systems. We've tried to maintain a vanilla+ feel while focusing on changes that will freshen up the experience for players. Mods such as [Harder Better Faster Stronger](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/55542), [Fair Care](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/55293), and [Take Cover](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/54976) will make encounters feel more dynamic and challenging.

* Player Homes:
Many new player homes accompanied by quests or found hidden throughout Vvardenfell. Wizard towers, secluded hideouts, luxurious estates, and updated existing player homes all can be found throughout the game for you to settle down and take a breather.

* Stability, Balance, Bug Fixes, & Performance Improvements:
A large problem with Morrowind, modded or not,  is that it is party to a host of issues. Without boring you all with the details, I will mention again that this list was made with resources such as Modding-OpenMW and the OpenMW discord. OpenMW itself offers many improvements to stability, and mods such as Patch for Purists handle many bugs and inconsistencies.

* Disclaimer to the Above: Performance can be subjective, the list was made on a PC with a Ryzen 5 9600x, RX 6700 XT, 32 GB RAM, and an NVMe SSD. At 1080p it stays locked at 60 FPS in 90% of areas and often went above that when uncapped. You may experience a performance hit in larger cities, such as Vivec, or Old Ebonheart in Tamriel Rebuilt. If you know what you're doing, we recommend adjusting some of your launcher and/or in-game graphical settings to alleviate those hits.

## **What is it Not?**
- **A Modifiable List (For the Time Being):** As we iron out issues with the compiled list, we have no time to support custom additions to the list.
- **A Vanilla/Vanilla+ Experience:** This is by no means a small or vanilla+ list+.
