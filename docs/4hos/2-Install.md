 Always put your modlists/steam games on the root of your drive as shown above to avoid issues with protected directories.

 Additionally, If the installation fails at Sforzinda Imitations you may download the file from **[here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yj9cxN0MAFQVuOpDNg2NJl0BAZHZm7CZ/edit)**.

### 6.) Opening Mod Organizer 2 & Setting Directories
- After Wabbajack installation is done, go to the modlist's folder and open Mod Organizer 2.
- When MO2 opens, ensure that all of the application directories in the dropdown match the locations on your system.
- This dropdown is at the top right of MO2. If the locations do not match, change them so that they do.

### 7.) Managing Your Game Directory
- At the top left of MO2, go to Tools/Settings/Paths/Managed Game.
- Make sure that this is set to your Halls of Sovngarde folder & not your Vanilla Skyrim (IE: `C:/HoS/Stock Game/SkyrimSE.exe`)
