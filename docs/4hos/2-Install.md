# **Part 1: Installation Guide**

### 1.) Install a fresh copy of Skyrim SE

> If a copy has already been installed the game can be uninstalled, ini's deleted in User/Documents/My Games/Skyrim Special Edition, and then reinstalled like normal through steam

### 2.) Make sure the game has been ran at least once to the main menu to generate the required fresh ini's and update all CC content through the Creations menu

### 3.) Launch your installed Wabbajack & go to the Cogwheel at the top right. Log into your Nexus account through here

### 4.) If you are installing the list through Wabbajack’s Gallery, go to “Browse Modlists” then search Halls of Sovngarde. Click the download icon,

### 5.) Set your modlist installation location to wherever your would like it (IE: C:/Modlists/HoS) & it will automatically create the downloads directory for you. Press the play button when you are done and installation will begin

> If the installation fails at Sforzinda Imitations you may download the file from **[here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yj9cxN0MAFQVuOpDNg2NJl0BAZHZm7CZ/edit)**. Place this into your populated `Halls of Sovngarde/downloads` folder, then restart the Wabbajack installation

### 6.) After Wabbajack installation is done make sure in MO2 that all of the application directories in the dropdown match the locations on your system. If they do not, change them so that they do.

### 7.) At the top left of MO2, go to Tools/Settings/Paths/Managed Game. Make sure that this is set to your Halls of Sovngarde folder & not your Vanilla Skyrim (IE: C:/HoS/Stock Game/SkyrimSE.exe)

> The following steps will need to be done every time the list is installed/updated

### 8.) At the top left of MO2, click on the puzzle icon which will open up a dropdown menu for various tools. Choose Set CPU Affinity and first clear if there's anything there, then select the tool again and change the affinity

### 9.) You can now select “Halls of Sovngarde” from the right hand dropdown and press play

- For lower end machines, all LOD output and grass mods can be disabled and the Ugly Skyrim mod can be activated
- Additionally CS and Reshade can be disabled
- Reshade can be changed in game to choose from a selection of ini's
- If instead of CS you want to run an ENB, first, enable mods under the separator "Enable for All ENB", then find the appropriate ENB separators and enable all mods under one of them
- For each plugin, place it where shown, if not shown, place above Embers XD.esp
