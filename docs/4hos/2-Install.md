## **Requirements:**
- ~200GB of space, 98GB from downloads can be deleted after installation is complete 
- A legal copy of Skyrim SE from steam updated to the most recent version
- Skyrim: SE Creation Kit Installed **(It Can be found [Here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1946180/Skyrim_Special_Edition_Creation_Kit/))**
:::

# **Part 1: Installation Guide**

### 1.) Install a fresh copy of Skyrim SE

> If a copy has already been installed the game can be uninstalled, ini's deleted in User/Documents/My Games/Skyrim Special Edition, and then reinstalled like normal through steam

### 2.) Make sure the game has been ran at least once to the main menu to generate the required fresh ini's

### 3.) Launch your installed Wabbajack & go to the Cogwheel at the top right. Log into your Nexus account through here

### 4.) If you are installing the list through Wabbajack’s Gallery, go to “Browse Modlists” then search Halls of Sovngarde. Click the download icon,

### 5.) Set your modlist installation location to wherever your would like it (IE: C:/Modlists/HoS) & it will automatically create the downloads directory for you. Press the play button when you are done and installation will begin

> The installation will fail at Sforzinda Imitations. While we sort this out, you may download the file from **[here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yj9cxN0MAFQVuOpDNg2NJl0BAZHZm7CZ/edit)**. Place this into your populated `Halls of Sovngarde/downloads` folder, then restart the Wabbajack installation

### 6.) After Wabbajack installation is done make sure in MO2 that all of the application directories in the dropdown match the locations on your system. If they do not, change them so that they do.

### 7.) At the top left of MO2, go to Tools/Settings/Paths/Managed Game. Make sure that this is set to your Halls of Sovngarde folder & not your Vanilla Skyrim (IE: C:/HoS/Stock Game/SkyrimSE.exe)

### 8.) You can now select “Halls of Sovngarde” from the right hand dropdown and press play
