## Akatosh  

**Blessing Conditions**

* No current crime bounties.
* Less than 3000 lifetime crime bounty for greater blessings, or less than 10,000 with the perk Aedric Realignment for Cure Disease only.

**Greater Shrine Blessings**

Absorbing dragon souls grants the following blessings from Shrines of Akatosh:

* (Oblivion Lore) Jaws of Akatosh: Fortify Movement Speed: +2.5% per 5 dragon souls absorbed (max +25% for 50 dragon souls).
* Bormahu Yol: Constant area effect. Incinerates disloyal dragons and those who serve them. Increases in power for every 10 dragon souls absorbed (max after 30 dragon souls). When Bormahu Yol is active, it's displayed in the active effects menu and by the minor visual effect it creates, which is identical to the one used by base Requiem for the Restoration spell Healing Aura. The effect is otherwise invisible - until you walk up close to hostile dragons and their worshipers.

+25% for each Main Quest completed starting with Bleak Falls Barrow (max +350% for 18 Main Quests completed).   
+25% from an Amulet of Akatosh.

Jaws of Alduin weakens PCs who transgress too severely.  

## Arkay
**Blessing Conditions**

* Receiving greater blessings requires wearing an Amulet of Arkay.

Starts minor fire damage and a small chance to stagger effected NPCs (max of 3 damage/second for 250 undead laid to rest). Beware having this blessing active when interacting with quest-giving undead NPCs, as this will lay them to rest if they turn hostile. When Arkay's Cleansing is active, it appears in the active effects menu and through a minor visual effect, which is identical to the one used by base Requiem for the Restoration spell Healing Aura. The effect is otherwise invisible - until you walk up close to undead and they catch on fire.  
* Fortify Health: 
+5 for every 25 undead laid to rest (max +70 after 350 undead laid to rest).   
+10 Fortify Health from an Amulet of Arkay.﻿

Arkay's Cleansing: consequence for the undead and necromancers:  

 Weakens necromancers, the undead, and those who have removed their souls from Arkay's control, when attempting to wear an Amulet of Arkay or activate a Shrine of Arkay.  

This occurs if:

* PC is a werewolf (PC's soul is no longer under Arkay's control).  
* PC traps more than 5 souls into soul gems (manipulating souls away from Arkay's control).

* (Oblivion Lore) Fortify Movement Speed: +5% (+50% max after absorbing 50 dragon souls).
* Auri-El's Protection: reduces damage from disloyal dragons and those who serve them by 10% for every 10 dragons slain (40% max damage reduction after 30 dragons slain).

## Boethiah

**Blessing**

* The Ebony Mail: This powerful artifact grants its wearer resistance to fire and magic, near immunity to poison, silent movement, and the ability to poison enemies who draw near. Only those worthy are granted its power, and Boethiah alone determines who should possess the Mail, and for how long a time. Boethiah will remove her blessing from any current champion who shows weakness, unless they prove themselves strong once again.  

Losing more than 85% of current Health, Stamina, or Magicka will remove all powers from the Ebony Mail unless a PC survives to bring their vitality above 15% again.  

## Clavicus Vile

**Blessings**

* Masque of Clavicus Vile: Legend tells the tale of Avalea, a noblewoman of some renown. As a young girl, she was grossly disfigured by a spiteful servant. Avalea made a deal with Clavicus Vile and received the Masque in return. Though the Masque did not change her looks, suddenly she had the respect and admiration of everyone. A year and a day after her marriage to a well connected baron, Clavicus Vile reclaimed the Masque. Although pregnant with his child, Avalea was banished from the Baron's household. Twenty one years and one day later, Avalea's daughter claimed her vengeance by slaying the Baron.  

(Skyrim lore) Offers Daedric armor protection with half the weight, and (Morrowind lore) makes the wearer incredibly charming, but with a bitter catch...  

* Rueful Axe: "One of Clavicus's little jests. A wizard named Sebastian Lort had a daughter who worshiped Hircine. When the daughter became a werewolf it drove Sebastian over the edge. He couldn't stand to see his little girl take on such a bestial form. The wizard wished for the ability to end his daughter's curse. Clavicus gave him an axe." —Barbas, when asked about the axe.

A powerful weapon, though it may occasionally aid those it strikes...  

## Dibella

**Blessing Conditions**

* Receiving greater blessings requires wearing an Amulet of Dibella.
* No current crime bounties.
* Less than 3000 lifetime crime bounty for greater blessings, or less than 10,000 with the perk Aedric Realignment for Cure Disease only.
* Less than 10 stolen items for greater blessings, or less than 20 with the perk Aedric Realignment for Cure Disease only.
* Less than 10 pickpocketed items for greater blessings, or less than 20 with the perk Aedric Realignment for Cure Disease only.

Pantea's Flute  
Finn's Lute  
Rjorn's Drum  
Have at least one Mark of Dibella in PC inventory from the quest Caught Red Handed (in Riften from Svana). Fully completing the quest will cause Dibella sorrow, though doesn't affect her offering of grace.
Lisbet's Missing Shipment (in Markarth from Lisbet).  

Dibella's Sorrow: Fully completing the quest Caught Red Handed (in Riften from Svana) disappoints Dibella for conspiring against her priestess, and brings a -10% Speech debuff. Partially completing this quest does not trouble her.  

Dibella's Disdain: Weakens PCs who transgress too severely.  

Though Dibella does not publicly support Sanguine's dabauchery, there are rumors she can be wooed by presenting her with his Rose as a Shrine offering.  
* Dibella's Flower Bearer: Equip Sanguine's Rose before activating a Shrine of Dibella for +50% Sneak and Evasion experience skill rates.
* Equipping Sanguine's Rose whenever activating a Shrine of Dibella improves the blessings from Dibella's Muse, Dibella's Grace, and Agent of Lovers.

## Forsworn and the Old Gods

* A PC attempting to wear Forsworn armor without demonstrating service or predilection to the Old Gods will result in a curse of wasting exhaustion. This can be overcome by the following:
Being in the Forsworn Faction.  
Rescuing Madanach from Cidna Mine and helping him escape Markarth.  
Possessing any of the Daedric artifacts of Hircine, Mehrunes Dagon, Namira, or Malacath.  
Possessing the Eye of Melka.  
Being a Breton.  
* Red Eagle's swords and Bloodthorne are now also Forsworn relics affiliated with Daedra, with both the benefits and the Aedric/Vigilant drawbacks that entails.

## Julianos

**Blessing Conditions**

* Being the Aedra of Law, Logic, and Contradiction, Julianos is not concerned with what you do, only with what is prosecutable. If the court systems of Skyrim are not concerned, then neither is Julianos. The exception is that Julianos frowns upon openly affiliating with criminal organizations regardless of whether a PC has any crime bounties.
* Receiving greater blessings requires wearing an Amulet of Julianos.
* No current crime bounties.
* Less than 3000 lifetime crime bounty for greater blessings, or less than 10,000 with the perk Aedric Realignment for Cure Disease only.
* Not finished the Dark Brotherhood quest With Friends Like These...
* Not finished the Thieves Guild quest Taking Care of Business.

+10 from wearing an Amulet of Julianos.

Julianos exalts scholars who pursue the truth, including Daedric knowledge.  
* Oghma's Scholar: Requires the Oghma Infinium kept in PC inventory. +75% experience skill rate for all schools of magic. Can be combined with Elder Scroll Scholar.

## Kynareth

**Blessing Conditions**

* Kynareth, being the embodiment of nature, is not concerned with the laws of Man or Mer. She frowns upon wasteful murder, though accepts killing for sustenance and survival. Affiliations with Daedra are scorned, for they have no regard for nature.
* Receiving greater blessings requires wearing an Amulet of Kynareth.
* PC has not mortally damaged her sacred tree.
* Committed less than 6 murders and killed less than 6 of any form of Spriggan for greater blessings, or less than 8 with the perk Aedric Realignment for Cure Disease only.

An area effect around the PC causing all aggressive animals to become more docile and begin play fighting, reducing their attack damage by 25% after the PC has discovered 70 locations.  
Bringing an Eldergleam sapling back to the Temple of Kynareth in Whiterun improves the blessing, reducing animal attack damage by 50%.  
Bringing an Eldergleam sapling back to the Temple of Kynareth in Whiterun and discovering 140 locations reduces animal and Spriggan attack damage by 75%.  
When Kynareth's Protection is active, it displays in the active effects menu and a minor visual effect, which is identical to the one used by base Requiem for the Restoration spell Healing Aura. The effect is otherwise invisible - until you walk up close to the wild animals and creatures listed.

Kynareth's Fury: Weakens PCs who transgress too severely.  

## Kyne

**Blessing Conditions**

* PC is not a Mer race, except Dunmer.

* PC has no Elven, Orcish, Glass, or Daedric artifacts, weapons, or armor, including the Necromancer's Amulet.
* PC does not have Auri-El's Bow or Shield.

**Shrine Blessings**

* All of Kyne's Blessings are activated at Shrines of Kynareth, as half of Kynareth is a veiled devotion to Kyne (the other half being Y'ffre).
* Fortify Endurance (Health and Stamina):
+5 Shrine Blessing (Wearing Kyne's Token and activating a Shrine of Kynareth).  
+5 for every Companions quest completed (max of +60 after completing 12 Companions quests).  
+20 for completing the Main quest Soverngarde (immediately preceding the final battle with Alduin).

Mara's Sorrow: Weakens PCs who transgress too severely.  

## Namira

**Blessing/Decay:**

* Ring of Namira: Grants greater favor to those with strong stomachs. Most of her favor is now given while digesting the flesh of the dead, with both great bounties of stamina, increased health, and ravaging blessings that accompany her exaltation.

## Nocturnal

**Blessing Conditions**

Nocturnal doesn't care what you do.  

**Greater Shrine Blessings** 

* Fortify Sneak: +10% for every 50 items stolen, up to a maximum of +50% at or above 250 items stolen.
* Fortify Lockpicking (expertise): +10 for every 25 locks picked, up to a maximum of +50 at or above 125 locks picked.
* Fortify Pickpocketing: +10% for every 50 items pickpocketed, up to a maximum of +50% at or above 250 items pickpocketed.

## Peryite

**Blessing**

* Spellbreaker: Provides a powerful protective ward from magic when used to block, and a constant fog of pestilent Silence that drains magic from friend and foe alike.

## Sanguine

**Blessings**

* The Sanguine Rose opens the gates to his servants and revelers, though he strongly encourages his adherents to at least show some decorum in making sure to show up intoxicated, if not also without clothing or armor...
* The Sanguine Rose is an extended prank in motion, though if a PC explores all of its permutations, Sanguine will have rewarded them significantly.
* Likes: Clavicus Vile, Mephala, Peryite, and Dibella. Brawls and pugilism. Pulp literature. Drunkenness, skooma intoxication, and skooma collectors.
* Dislikes: Affiliating with worshipers of most Aedra. Becoming Mara's Agent disappoints Sanguine. He's also saddened by anyone who completes the quest The Raid (in Riften from Wujeeta).
* Fear and Loathing in the Sanguine Rose: 
Taking off a PC's cuirass/clothes or putting them back on will often create different effects while the Sanguine Rose is activated.  
Taking off a PC's cuirass/clothes can summon people or Dremora, and causes the visual changes to be more intense.  
Putting a PC's cuirass/clothes on often makes animals appear, and causes the visual changes to be less intense.  
No revelry will usually take place if the PC isn't intoxicated with alcohol or skooma, or doesn't have some skooma on hand.  
Sanguine animals are likely filled with intoxicants and questionable intrigues.  
Sanguine revelers aren't particularly bothered if you get rowdy and take their stuff. They'll end back up in the Myriad Realms of Revelry anyways, no worse for wear.  
There are various Sanguine Roses from other Myriad Realms.  
Wearing Sanguine's Amulet, while intoxicated and not wearing clothing or armor, may bring satisfaction to a pugilist.  
Possessing pulp literature, while intoxicated and not wearing clothing or armor, may bring a smile to the debaucherous.

## Stendarr

**Blessing Conditions**

* Receiving greater blessings requires wearing an Amulet of Stendarr.
* No current crime bounties.
* Less than 3000 lifetime crime bounty, or less than 10,000 with the perk Aedric Realignment - both allow greater blessings.

* Less than 10 pickpocketed items, or less than 20 with the perk Aedric Realignment - both allow greater blessings.

* Not finished the Dark Brotherhood quest With Friends Like These...

Increases in strength for every 15 Daedra slain (max after 30 Daedra slain).  
When Stendarr's Justice is active, it displays in the active effects menu and as a minor visual effect it creates, which is identical to the one used by base Requiem for the Restoration spell Healing Aura. The effect is otherwise invisible until you're near hostile Deadra -and NPCs friendly to them- and they catch on fire.  
* Fortify Blocking: Additionally grants resistance to draining magic.
+10% Lesser Blessing from activating a Shrine of Stendarr while wearing an Amulet of Stendarr.
