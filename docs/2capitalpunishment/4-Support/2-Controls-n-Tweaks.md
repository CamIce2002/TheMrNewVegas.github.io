## **Controller Binds**

*Controls are Vanilla + JAM Controller Integration Controls*

 - It is suggested you either have an XInput Controller (Xbox Controller; So Far Have only Tested Xbox 360 Functioning Properly) or a program which spoofs non Xinput Controllers [(IE: DS4 Windows)](https://ds4-windows.com)
