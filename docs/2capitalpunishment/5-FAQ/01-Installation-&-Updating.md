# Installation & Updating

## **1.) Can I modify this pack?**

Due to the jankiness of New Vegas and the variety of conflicts introducing new mods can cause, we do not support any modification whatsoever for this pack. This includes, but is not limited to...

- Stewies Tweaks Changes
- New Mod Installations
- Disabling/Deleting Preexisting Mods
- Editing INI's of Existing Mods
- Bethini
> We do have channels where users may help eachother with unsupported modifications and have an active user base consistently discussing various changes they have made.

## **2.) I updated my game and ________ file is now gone. Where did it go?**

If the file did not come with the Wabbajack installation, then it will be deleted on the next update

> The main file is Tale of Two Wastelands.7zip. Make sure to follow our updating guide to ensure when you update, it doesn't delete out of your mods/downloads folders.

## **3.) I Cannot Launch My Game/I Keep Getting Crashes**

- Launch the game with New Vegas, NOT NVSE

- If this doesn't work, try verifying the integrity of FNV in steam

- If this does not work, go to your Fallout New Vegas steam folder and run 4 GB patcher again

- After this is done try to launch your game like normal

- If this doesn't work, try disabling DXVK or SpecialK

## **4.) How do I show the In Game Keybind Interface?**

You can press insert or view them on the Website [here](https://www.modlists.net/docs/2capitalpunishment/Support#key-bind-changes)
