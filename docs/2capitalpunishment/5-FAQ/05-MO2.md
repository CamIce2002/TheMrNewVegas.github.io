# MO2 & Common Questions

We receive a lot of questions on a day in/day out basis and many of them are pretty similar. For that reason, this page will be a dump of commonly asked questions users can refer to for better reference.

## MO2

### **1.) What does INI file is read only mean and what should I select?**

 - If you see this, select ‚ÄùClear the Read Only Flag‚Äù

- Then change ‚ÄùAlways Ask‚Äù at the bottom so you do not see that message again 
  
### **2.) How do I tell which version of Capital Punishment I have?**
  
This can be found at the top of your MO2 Window Highlighted in Blue

### **3.) Is save _x_ safe with version _y_?**

Please refer top the Saves & Updating section of the Wiki

## Common Questions

### How do I see the keybinds for the list?
- Press insert while in game

### What does save safe mean?  
- On the release notes we have a segment telling you whether or not the new version is save safe or not. This means that depending on what we add or remove, the new version might not work with a save from a previous version. This can range from minor bugs, items no longer existing, scripts breaking, all the way up to the game not launching. If you want to know if a new version of the game is save safe, either check ‚Å†üì£-announcements or check the release notes.  https://www.modlists.net/docs/2capitalpunishment/Release-Notes 

### Why can't I start in the Mojave? 
- Our original intention with this collection was to utilize the alternate start mod for NV considering how in-depth and how much roleplay it adds. Also we wanted to give the player the choice of NV or FO3. Sadly it wasn‚Äôt compatible with TTW and the only one that really is is TTW Quickstart. This jumps you straight into the capital and at the end of the day, turned out to be what was best for how TTW/the mod list is balanced.
TL;DR: Balancing and mod incompatibilities

### Can I remove X mod?  
- No. Changing the list will void support. Use ‚Å†üìú-unsupported-modifications if you understand this and want to continue.

### Where is my gear after traveling to the Mojave? 
- We use a mod called 'Benny Humbles You' that removes all your gear and some progression so NV isn't a breeze after completing 3. Here's the mod link if you want more info.
- https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/71112

### How do I remove the white icon in the middle of my screen? 
- Just Mods in MCM, then turn off the Hit Indicator.

### Why does my gun shake so much? 
- This is caused by either a low gun skill or low strength skill, or both. The higher the stat, the more steady your gun will be.

### How do I repair? 
- https://www.modlists.net/docs/2capitalpunishment/CraftingGuides/Repairing 

### How do I fast travel? 
- Fast travel is disabled by default but there are multiple alternatives available. https://www.modlists.net/docs/2capitalpunishment/GeneralGameplayGuides/Fast-Travel 

### How do I get the truck? 
- Talk to Crazy Wolfgang and purchase the pack from him. It'll be under misc and cost about 1500 caps. 

### Some additional quickstart info 
- https://www.modlists.net/docs/2capitalpunishment/GeneralGameplayGuides/Getting-Started

### I get thirsty so fast, can I change it? 
- Changing anything in the pack will void your support. Don't sprint so much and increase your Survival skill to get thirsty less.

### Can I edit anything about the modpack? 
- No. Unfortunately with the amount of work that goes into making lists, we simply do not have the time to offer support for people adding or removing mods. This includes things that may see simple like ini tweaks.

### How do I switch between Casual and Hardcore? 
- At the top of MO2, there is a bar that says "Profiles". Click it and select the profile you want from the drop down. 

### Why can't I get past the Bethesda/Obsidian logo?
- This seems to be an issue with Overwolf. Try disabling that.

### How do I fix my main menu looking like a corrupted rainbow? 
- In game, go to Settings->Display, and changing "Texture Size" to "Large." Thanks to @Frankus for the fix. 

### I'm getting a false positive during the Wabbajack installer. How do I add an exception to Windows Security? 
- https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/add-an-exclusion-to-windows-security-811816c0-4dfd-af4a-47e4-c301afe13b26

### Why does Red disappear after rescuing her and bringing her back to Big Town?
- Red likes to walk out of town for some reason during the time that the super mutants plan to invade. What is likely happening is she is pathing to them (Which is what we witnessed), then being instant killed. If you follow her out of town, then deal with the Super Mutants ahead in a quick fashion, she should live and return to Big Town.

### Why is Load Order Library different than my current load order?
- While we use load order library to help with Mod Organizer's love for reorganizing load orders, we also use it to back up our own work on future revisions. Please always check pins in ‚Å†Unknown  if you believe load order library does not match the current revision. 

### How do I Use the Grenade Hotkey/Quick Throw?
- Manually equip and hold the grenade in your hand. Then, press Z & G to bind it. Now whenever you press G, that specific grenade will be pulled out similar to a hotkey. Then, you left click to throw.

### Why Isn't B42 Quickthrow/Another Quickthrow Mod Used? 
- We use B.A.T.H because B42 Quickthrow does not take the player's explosives or other skills into account when throwing items paired with the fact that BATH is much more openly favored and actively developed.

### How do I bind a weapon to the Weapon Hweel?: 
- Open your pipboy and hover your cursor/selector over the weapon you would like to put onto your wheel. Without moving the cursor/selector, hold H. With H still held, left click one of the open slots in the wheel to bind your weapon to it. 

### Why do I have two quest markers? - This is JAM and MUX both enabling quest markers. Make sure you use the pre-configured save as it has all the MCM changes and keybinds done beforehand.

### Why am I getting a Script Overwrite Detected pop-up when I load a save? 
- [More Info Here](https://discord.com/channels/415287319982112768/1170746363647098992/1210079722307059742)


### If anyone experiences NCR and Ringo immediately attacking you on sight after traveling to the Mojave 
- It's an old TTW bug with faction reputation. DC BoS is hostile towards NCR, and considering you are most likely going to be friends with DC BoS that somehow bugs out the Mojave reputations after traveling there. I've seen some people on here fixing it by using console commands to remove Ringo's hostile status, but an easier way to do it is to get a BoS uniform, equip and unequip it. After that you are good to go. An easy way to get a BoS uniform with console commands - type search "brotherhood recon armor", then player.additem armorid 1 where armorid is the id you get from the previous command
- Thanks to @SplendidAlakey for this 

### Do I need to install the mods after the TTW installer? 
- No, all of this is handled by Wabbajack. You only need to run the TTW launcher and zip the output.

### I‚Äôm getting a giant red ! in the Wasteland/outside the Vault/inside 
- Report this in #ttw-bug-reports. If it is confirmed not to be a mod list issue, rerun the TTW installer

### I have a PCR version of the game and cannot continue with the Wabbajack install 
- ‚Å†[Regarding the PCR Game Version](https://discord.com/channels/415287319982112768/1154060932570423357/1154061977321210029)

### I had a PCR version but bought a Global version to play, why does it still not work? 
- To fix this problem, you need to have the English Global version installed. Removing the PCR version from your Steam account seems to also help.

### Why do I have a black box in the center of the screen when loading? 
- If you're running an Ultrawide monitor, you need to enable Ultrawide support in the Tweaks setting. Search with this name.
```Ultra-wide Black Rectangle, and Zoomed Menus/Scope Fix - fix bugs with 21:9+ resolutions where the fade-to-black effect would not cover the whole screen, and scopes/lockpick/terminals were zoomed in too far```
