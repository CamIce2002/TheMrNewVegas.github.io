## **1.) What does INI file is read only mean and what should I select?**

 - If you see this, select ”Clear the Read Only Flag”

- Then change ”Always Ask” at the bottom so you do not see that message again 
  
## **2.) How do I tell which version of Capital Punishment I have?**
  
This can be found at the top of your MO2 Window Highlighted in Blue
