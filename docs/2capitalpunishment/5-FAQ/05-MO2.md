## Common Questions

### How do I set up keybinds? 
- You can either use the preconfigured save provided by us that will have all the keybinds already set up or you can use your own and set it up through MCM. We highly recommend you use the save we provide though. It makes things much easier. 

### What are the keybinds for x mod?  
- Press Ins on your keyboard and an overlay will pop up showing the keybinds on keyboard then controller.

### What does save safe mean?  
- On the release notes we have a segment telling you whether or not the new version is save safe or not. This means that depending on what we add or remove, the new version might not work with a save from a previous version. This can range from minor bugs, items no longer existing, scripts breaking, all the way up to the game not launching. If you want to know if a new version of the game is save safe, either check ‚Å†üì£-announcements or check the release notes.  https://www.modlists.net/docs/2capitalpunishment/Release-Notes 
### How do I travel to the Mojave?  - https://www.modlists.net/docs/2capitalpunishment/GeneralGameplayGuides/Travelling-Between-the-Capital-and-Mojave 

### Why can't I start in the Mojave? 
- Our original intention with this collection was to utilize the alternate start mod for NV considering how in-depth and how much roleplay it adds. Also we wanted to give the player the choice of NV or FO3. Sadly it wasn‚Äôt compatible with TTW and the only one that really is is TTW Quickstart. This jumps you straight into the capital and at the end of the day, turned out to be what was best for how TTW/the mod list is balanced.
TL;DR: Balancing and mod incompatibilities

### Can I remove X mod?  
- No. Changing the list will void support. Use ‚Å†üìú-unsupported-modifications if you understand this and want to continue.

### Where is my gear after traveling to the Mojave? 
- We use a mod called 'Benny Humbles You' that removes all your gear and some progression so NV isn't a breeze after completing 3. Here's the mod link if you want more info.

### How do I remove the white icon in the middle of my screen? 
- Just Mods in MCM, then turn off the Hit Indicator.

### Why does my gun shake so much? 
- This is caused by either a low gun skill or low strength skill, or both. The higher the stat, the more steady your gun will be.

### How do I repair?

### How do I fast travel? 
- Fast travel is disabled by default but there are multiple alternatives available. https://www.modlists.net/docs/2capitalpunishment/GeneralGameplayGuides/Fast-Travel 

### How do I get the truck? 
- Talk to Crazy Wolfgang and purchase the pack from him. It'll be under misc and cost about 1500 caps.
