1.) Install a Fresh Copy of Fallout New Vegas & 3 (English Language Only). **Once installation is finished, launch them once and a popup should appear saying detecting game settings.** 

2.) Set your resolution and other settings to your liking and close the launcher after

3.) Grab the [4GB Patcher Mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/62552) (First file, description says does not require VC Redist)

4.) Unzip the 7ZIP file this comes in, then drag and drop the contents (FNVpatch.exe) to your main Fallout NV Directory.

5.) Double click ```FNVpatch.exe``` and your FalloutNV.exe should be patched to work with the list!

:::info
- This list uses DXVK. If your setup does not support DX-Vulkan, you can disable it at the top of the list under "Optional Installs & Performance"
> To know if you can, cannot, or must modify your setup to use DXVK, you can read more [here](https://performance.moddinglinked.com/falloutnv.html#DXVK).

- We also highly recommend that users install Special-K. This can both help limit frames for better performance in addition to a multitude of other performance enhancing features.
> For more information on Special-K, click [here](https://performance.moddinglinked.com/falloutnv.html#specialk)

1.) Launch your installed Wabbajack & go to the Cogwheel at the top right. Log into your Nexus account through here

2A.) If you are installing the list from the Nexus download, unzip the folder you downloaded. Then, inside of Wabbajack, go to "Install From Disk". Find the .wabba file you just unzipped and select it

2B.) If you are installing the list through Wabbajack's Gallery, go to "Browse Modlists" then search Capital Punishment or find us under the Fallout: New Vegas category. Click the download icon,

3.) Set your modlist installation location to wherever your would like it (IE: C:/Modlists/Capital Punishment) & it will automatically create the downloads directory for you. Press the play button when you are done and installation will begin.

1.) Download and unzip the [TTW 3.3.2 Installer](https://mod.pub/ttw/133/files). Then create a new folder called `[NoDelete] Tale of Two Wastelands`

> The `[No Delete]` tag has recently been having issues. PLEASE BACK UP YOUR TALE OF TWO WASTELANDS OUTSIDE OF YOUR CAPITAL PUNISHMENT FOLDER

2.) Make sure Steam is fully closed, then run the Tale of Two Wastelands Launcher. Where it says to set your paths, set them to where your `Fallout 3`, `Fallout NV`, & `[NoDelete] Tale of Two Wastelands` main directories are located, then press install (This takes a while)

3.) After the TTW Launcher successfully completes the installation, use 7Zip, Winrar, or Windows Explorer to zip up the `[NoDelete] Tale of Two Wastelands` folder into an archive. You may now safely delete Fallout 3 from your computer.

4.) When Wabbajack successfully completes installing the modlist, drag the Zipped Archive you just made into your `Capital Punishment/Downloads` directory. Go back to your main `Capital Punishment directory`, then open up `Mod Organizer 2`

5.) On the right hand side, sort by Filetime until you see your `[NoDelete] Tale of Two Wastelands.7z` at the top. Drag and drop this to the top of the lefthand separator `PUT TALE OF TWO WASTELANDS HERE`
