## **Radiant Infinium**
[Link to Nexus Page](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/83610)

Job Boards/Terminals:
Job boards and terminals can be found in almost every settlement in the Wasteland. These are the point of contact with the opportunities presented by this mod. Each job board/terminal represents the settlement it is located in, each one offers a different selection of quests with objectives based on the settlement's relations to other factions.

Quest Rewards:
For now, you will only be rewarded with XP, caps, and fame. XP rewarded is dynamically generated based the what the quest requires you to do. The amount of caps rewarded is based on the level you are and what quest you're doing, additionally, a heightened barter skill will increase the amount of caps you get per quest. The fame gain from these quests are quite meager, but are a good way of building up reputation for factions that don't offer much in regards of fame gain. Completing these quests in succession has a high chance to yield great experience and monetary gains.

Quest Limit:
The recycling of quests is what makes this mod tick! Whenever you finish one of the quests, it gets added into a pool of inactive quests so it can be assigned totally different objectives in the future. In terms of limit, you are currently limited to 100 radiant quests. No, I will not increase this because there is no reason for you to have 100 active quests... ever.

Multiple Quest types:
Delivery: Deliver packages to the people of the Wasteland! These quests won't have you trekking across the Wasteland to make a simple parcel delivery, the package recipient is chosen based on their distance from the assigning job board and their relations to the faction the board belongs to. Quest rewards and XP are determined by the distance between the starting location and the Package Recipient.

Delivery (Mojave Express): Unlike your standard Delivery job, the Mojave Express counterpart doesn't see distance or faction relations as a means to an end. These missions will have you hiking across the Wasteland, delivering to any character in need of Courier 6's package.

Exterminate: Cleanse the Wasteland of Irradiated Abominations. These quests involve tracking down multiple creatures within a specific vicinity of the settlement you're picking the job up from. These contracts will have you taking on anything from Feral Ghouls to Deathclaws. But don't worry, the tougher jobs will only be offered to higher leveled players.

Hunt: Whether it's their general nuisance or because people are hungry, the Hunt job exists to serve. This job will have you search for and kill some of the various animals of the Wasteland.

Scavenge: Scavenge quests necessitate the player to locate a specific quantity of a particular miscellaneous item for a given settlement. Sure, these kinds of quests have never been the most fun - but the items you're searching for will yield more caps to you than simply selling the same amount in a shop.

Gather: Much like the aforementioned Fetch quest, Gather quests involve the player collecting herbs, plants, and other helpful items from the Wasteland for a settlement.

Kill: Resembling a bounty-esque contract, Kill quests entail hunting down and eliminating an NPC hostile or unfriendly to the hiring settlement. A great addition to players who're bloodthirsty and feel like they ran out of things to kill - or - players that are just downright bloodthirsty.

Eliminate: Much like the Kill quest type, Eliminate quests are specifically for singular radioactive abominations, often requiring higher-level players.
