# Reshade Installation

## **What is Reshade**

- ReShade is a generic post-processing injector for games and video software developed by crosire. Think of it as a filter that goes over the top of your game's visuals allowing for ambient occlusion, real depth of field effects, color correction, and a lot more

## **Why is this no longer included with Capital Punishment?**

- After many reports of out of memory errors, performance issues, et cetera, we decided we would leave it up to the users to make the decision whether or not they wanted to use reshade

## **What are the benefits of using Reshade with this list**

- Besides for the arguably better visuals it can offer with the right presets, we also provide files which can bring up control and keybind interfaces for our preconfigured saves in real time while you are playing. Forget a keybind? By pressing insert, you can pull up the keybinds with ease.

## **Installation Guide**

- Go to the reshade website [here](https://reshade.me) and download the latest reshade with full add-on support at the bottom of the page

- Run the Reshade Setup Exe that is downloaded. When it opens, browse for your Fallout New Vegas installation and select your FalloutNV.exe. Open this file, then select next.
