Fast travel is in the game! But not how you think. Fast travel is one of the best, yet least immersive things about Fallout. However, now that is a thing of the past! There are several ways the player may fast travel which will be detailed below!

A faction of roaming wanderers, these people will take you from point A to point B â€“ for a few caps of course. They can be found at any and every settlement and offer 20 travel locations. Why not try them out, find their settlement, or even apply for a PREMIUM travel membership?
