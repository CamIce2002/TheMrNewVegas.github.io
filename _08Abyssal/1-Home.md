## **What is Abyssal?**

Abyssal is a work in progress mod list for Starfield. While it is currently a relatively small list with few changes, it will be an everchanging list with an eventual focus reached once modding tools and capability are expanded upon (and hopefully an eventual Wabbajack release once MO2 support is fully available/out of beta).

## **What is it Not?**
- **A Modifiable List (For the Time Being):** As we iron out issues with the compiled list we have no time to support extra additions to the list
- **A Vanilla/Vanilla+ Experience:** This is by no means a small or vanilla+ list+

## **How do I Get Help?**
1.) Make sure to look at the installation guide and follow in order.

2.) The next step would be to check our FAQ (Coming Soon)

3.) If your issue is not in the FAQ or Installation Guide, take the time to look around the Wiki (Especially if it's a gameplay related questions)

4.) If your question is unanswered in our documentation, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/43EhRjU). Some fixes that we have included there are not integrated to the wiki yet. Please look through our #abyssal-help, #abyssal-fixes, #abyssal-bug-reports, in addition to looking through pins, announcements, and using the search function

5.) If after your searches you still cannot find your issue, make a help post in #abyssal-help on our discord and we will get to it as soon as possible!

## DO NOT ASK MOD AUTHORS OR OTHER DISCORDS FOR HELP
