## **1.) Can I modify this pack?**

Due to the jankiness of New Vegas and the variety of conflicts introducing new mods can cause, we do not support any modification whatsoever for this pack. This includes, but is not limited to...

- Stewies Tweaks Changes
- New Mod Installations
- Disabling/Deleting Preexisting Mods
- Editing INI's of Existing Mods
- Installing New Reshade Presets
> Reshade preset changes/additions are loosely unsupported as a reshade preset may be running on a newer/older version of reshade versus the one we are running. This wont cause issues necessarily with gameplay, but may not work as intended.

## **2.) I updated my game and ________ file is now gone. Where did it go?**

If the file did not come with the Wabbajack installation, then it will be deleted on the next update

> The main file is Tale of Two Wastelands.7zip. Make sure to follow our[UPDATING GUIDE](https://github.com/TheMrNewVegas/TTWTrueVegas/wiki/Updating) to ensure when you update, it doesn't delete out of your mods/downloads folders.

## **3.) I Cannot Launch My Game/I am Getting Cannot Read Arguments**

- Launch the game with New Vegas, NOT NVSE

- If this doesn't work, try verifying the integrity of FNV in steam

- If this does not work, go to your Fallout New Vegas steam folder (Which should be completely clean of any alterations)

- From there copy all of the files inside and paste them into your Stock Games folder

- Run the 4GB Patcher

- After this is done try to launch your game like normal

## **4.) How do I show the In Game Keybind Interface?**

If you are on the preconfigured save, just press the INSERT button on your keyboard to switch between the reshade and the controls overlay


## **5.) Where can I find an updated list of mods?**

## **6.) When I launch the game, it loads the black dialog box, but does not launch the game. How do I fix this?**
This is likely due to preexisting INI's or other files being prevalent in your %USER$/My Games/FalloutNV folder. Delete these files, then follow the steps below

- Run Tale of Two Wastelands through MO2.
- 
- When the New Vegas Launcher pops up, change your resolution/your preset to your preferred preset. Exit the launcher
- 
- Run Tale of Two Wastelands through MO2 again
- 
- A popup will appear asking if you would like to "Clear the Read Only Flag" choose the first option stating "Clear the Read Only Flag"
