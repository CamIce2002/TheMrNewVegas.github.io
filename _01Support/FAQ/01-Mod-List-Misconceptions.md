## **1.) Is this list broken?**

While this list is not perfect, it is far from broken and is regularly maintained. At one point in time I could not have said this as confidently as I do now. From the days of our broken vortex packs we have come a long way in ensuring this is as stable and smooth as it can possibly be. In the end we have had numerous users report easily logging full playthroughs spanning 50-200 hours without save corrupts, crashes, or other issues.

## **2.) Do you know what you're doing?**

When I first started, I had zero clue as to the New Vegas modding environment. I used Project Nevada because I thought it was the cool all in one mod and pretty much did what everyone else does; downloaded what looked cool. By a stroke of luck my collection rose into the top five most downloaded, endorsed, etc categories quickly, and with that I had to learn quickly. I have learned a lot in that time and I am still learning today. I can say that from the days of Vortex to now I definitely know much more than I did. XEdit is currently what I know the least about, but with the support of my team, I have been able to learn and even implement numerous fixes that would have taken me much longer alone.

## **This person said that you/your mod list were _______. Is that true?**

Because of the infamy the vortex collections received, a lot of outdated information against the list and myself has been prevalent. I have been and will continue to be transparent about the content I put out and my modding competency. I would suggest doing your due diligence before allowing any party to sway your opinion. If you are reading this then that is probably the case.
