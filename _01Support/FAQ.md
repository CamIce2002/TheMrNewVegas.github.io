# **Mod List Misconceptions**
<details><summary>1.) Is this list broken?</summary>
While this list is not perfect, it is far from broken and is regularly maintained. At one point in time I could not have said this as confidently as I do now. From the days of our broken vortex packs we have come a long way in ensuring this is as stable and smooth as it can possibly be. In the end we have had numerous users report easily logging 50-100+ hours without save corrupts, crashes, or other issues. 
</details>
<details><summary>2.) Do you know what you're doing?</summary>
When I first started, I had zero clue as to the New Vegas modding environment. I used Project Nevada because I thought it was the cool all in one mod and pretty much did what everyone else does; just downloaded what looked cool. By a stroke of luck my collection rose into the top five most downloaded, endorsed, etc categories quickly, and with that I had to learn quickly. I have learned a lot in that time and I am still learning today, but can say that from the days of Vortex to now I definitely know much more than I did. XEdit is currently what I know the least about, but the team and myself are striving to fix that.
</details>
<details><summary>3.) This person said that you/your mod list were _______. Is that true?</summary>
Because of the infamy the vortex collections received, a lot of outdated information against the list and myself has been prevalent. I have been and will continue to be transparent about the content I put out and my modding competency. I would suggest doing your due diligence before allowing any party to sway your opinion. If you are reading this then that is probably the case.

# **Installation/Updating**
<details>
<summary>1.) I updated my game and ________ file is now gone. Where did it go?</summary>

- **If the file did not come with the Wabbajack installation, then it will be deleted on the next update**
> **The main files are the libvorbis, libvorbisfile, libogg, Tale of Two Wastelands.7zip. BACK THESE UP BEFORE UPDATING & FOLLOW OUR [UPDATING GUIDE](https://github.com/TheMrNewVegas/TTWTrueVegas/wiki/Updating)**

> **libogg.dll comes from the Tale of Two Wastelands installer, not Steam. You will need to rerun the installer if you do not back it up.**
</details>

<details><summary>2.) I Cannot Launch My Game/I am Getting Cannot Read Arguments</summary>

- **Launch the game with New Vegas, NOT NVSE**

- **If this doesn't work, try verifying the integrity of FNV in steam**

- **If this does not work, go to your Fallout New Vegas steam folder (Which should be completely clean of any alterations)**

- **From there copy all of the files inside and paste them into your Stock Games folder**

- **Run the 4GB Patcher**

- **After this is done try to launch your game like normal**

~ Thank you to [Afro](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0AU8onc8vlBxm3jaqYlM0g) for this fix!

</details>

<details><summary>3.) How do I show the In Game Keybind Interface?</summary>

- **Just press the INSERT button on your keyboard to switch between the reshade and the controls overlay**
</details>

<details><summary>4.) When I run the game for the after install/update, the New Vegas Launcher comes up! What do I do?</summary>

- **This is normal for a new install/update. Your inis are regenerated for the modpack. Click Okay then close the launcher, DO NOT start the game this way. Run New Vegas again then click "Clear the read-only flag". You should only have to do this after a fresh install or update.**

# **Gameplay**

<details><summary>1.) Why can't I start in the Mojave?</summary>

- **TL;DR at the end. Our original intention with this collection was to utilize the alternate start mod for NV considering how in depth and how much roleplay it adds. Also we wanted to give the player the choice of NV or FO3. Sadly it wasn't compatible with TTW and the only one that really is is TTW Quickstart, which jumps you straight into the capital. In addition this was best for how TTW/the mod list is balanced.**
> TL;DR: Balancing and mod incompatibilities</details>

<details><summary>2.) I feel like I start off extremely weak after leaving the Vault, why is that?</summary>

- **To put it into perspective; You're an 18 year old kid who just jumped out of the Vault and the only gun you've held so far shoots BBs. You probably stand a chance again mutated rats and roaches and maybe a raider or two. However, until you start getting more proficient with weapons and building into your characters levels more, the world is gonna punish you. If you feel like you've got to run away from a fight then you definitely should** </details>

<details><summary>3.) Why is the water messed up and blocky?</summary>

- **This is caused by an improperly set up ENB. The ENB is no longer supported as ReShade is installed. Please check the sidebar pertaining to the ENB.**</details>

<details><summary>4.) Where are the Sunset Sarsaparilla bottles during the tutorial? They aren't behind the building like usual.</summary>

- **Look to your left. You won't be shooting at the building anymore.**</details>

<details><summary>5.) How do I level up?</summary>

- **Sleep.**</details>

# **Tweaks**

<details><summary>1.) How do I make my own Stewie's Tweaks?</summary>

- **First try making the tweaks in game. If that doesn't work you can opt to delete the overwriting INI from True Vegas Resources. Just remember it comes back every update/make sure to backup your INI**</details>

# **Misc**

<details><summary>1.) I am trying to give Scribe Yearning Prewar Books, but they are all replaced with titled books.</summary>

- **Find the books in the AID section of your inventory, then hold left shift + left click on them. This should automatically convert the book to a Prewar book.** </details>

<details><summary>2.) Where is MCM?</summary>

- **Hit M after pausing the game.** </details>

<details><summary>3.) Can I change the HUD color?.</summary>

- **Yes. Hit N after pausing and you can adjust it from there.** </details>

<details><summary>4.) TTW? MO2? NVSE?? What are all these acronyms?</summary>

- **To save time and space, we sometimes use acronyms for words we're going to repeat a lot. Here is a non-exhaustive list of words.**

- TTW - Tale of Two Wastelands, the main mod this pack is built around. It combines Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas into one complete and seamless game!

- WJ - Wabbajack, the tool we use to automate the installation 

- FONV, NV, FO3 - Fallout New Vegas, New Vegas, Fallout 3. These are the games you need for the modpack 

- NVSE - New Vegas Script Extender, a mod that allows a lot of the game to be changed and really the core of most mods

- MO2 - Mod Organizer 2, the mod manager we use.
