## **Shoutout to Seldalore**
- He is the original author of the mod and walked me through the changes needed to make this mod work specifically how I was looking for it to. If you've got the time give him an endorsement on his [Wasteland Vampirism](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/79669?tab=files&BH=2) mod and check out his other mods [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/users/459172)

## General Features of the Vampirism Mod

- Living creatures will have Blood in their inventory on death.
- Taking the Fresh Blood instantly hydrates and heals. (used upon acquiring)
- Fresh Blood scales with the Medicine skill.
- Normal Blood Packs you find in the Wasteland won't do. It must be fresh. (see optional files)
- Food and drink have no positive effect on appetite.
- The more dehydrated you become, the more feral (increased damage, decreased damage resistance).
- Sunlight can be fatal. Be cautious when waiting outdoors. Especially at higher stages.
- While taking shelter from the sun, any accumulated RADs will shed, but dehydrate you faster while it does.
- While not in combat or in the sun, your health restores, but will also dehydrate you faster.
- The weather is much more agreeable for a vampire in D.C. compared to the desert. But don't let that stop you.
- Blood from mutated creatures and ghouls that additionally gives minor radiation resistance has been added, but acquiring it without Ghastly Scavenger will have a lesser effect and cause vomiting, which hurts (but won't kill).
- Tribal Wisdom enhances animal blood effects.
- Non-mutant blood can now remove radiation.
- Minor karma loss for drinking human blood.
- Fresh Blood Scales with Medicine Skill
- Vampires can sneak up on sleeping victims and activate a Feed prompt

## **How to Become a Vampire (Spoilers Ahead)**

### **Requirements:**
- The requirements are not necessarily needed until you reach the Mereseti Train Station. Try to start the quest early in your playthrough for the best results and if you need to come back later with higher levels, you can do so.
- Speech Level: 70 (**Optional**, Makes Getting to the End of the Questline Much Easier)
- Medicine Level: 30 or 50 (Hard Requirement)

### **Starting Blood Ties**

- Talk to Lucy West in Megaton. She can be found outside of her house around 8:20 AM in game time. Her house is located East of the Megaton Plaza Directly Above Mr. Burkes House. When she asks you to deliver a message make sure to accept by saying "Sure Why Not". She will give you a letter which you are to take to Arefu.

- When you arrive at Arefu (Northwest of Vault 101), talk to Evan King. State that you have the letter from the West Family. When he asks for you to investigate the issues in Arefu accept. Talk extensively to all of the residents of Arefu and find the bodies of the West family. Once you're done, report back to Evan.

- After reporting back to Evan, assure him youll "Figure Out What Happened to the Wests" and ask him "Where do you think I can find the Family?. Begin making your way to Mereseti Trainyard (East of Arefu)"

### **Getting to the Family**

- Once you've made your way through the Mereseti Trainstation, you will be met by Robert. He is the gate guard. This is where your speech will come in handy. You can either choose 70 speech to get into the Families Hideout or pay 100 caps to enter.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112358568/222066368-23176d14-79b1-4e9e-a7f6-fa956196ba89.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112358568/222066528-0f3d64e6-b845-42e9-b7e3-6bf34658b44d.png)

- After doing this enter the hideout through the gate behind Robert. You can talk to anyone in the family if you'd like but our main goal is talking to Vance. Strike up a conversation with him. Let him continue his speech he starts on and DO NOT ATTACK OR TRY TO PROVOKE HIM.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112358568/222066830-e4e12962-1e94-485e-8651-ba0db9e29403.png)

### **Speaking With Vance & Finding Ian**

- After his speech is over you can use Speech 70 again, this time to learn what "The Family" is about. If you do not have 70 speech you will be required to read through the family terminal. This will come up here shortly

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112358568/222067098-3444852a-0cd4-45fd-91fc-755f1dfca153.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112358568/222067139-a41e5827-8f40-4e78-b3e0-7a42d6e0cecb.png)

- Tell Vance you have been searching for Ian, and that you have a letter from his sister. From here I usually just choose the first option in the dialogue until I reach The Dialogue Which States "Please, You Must Let me Speak to Him". If you did not do the prior speech check, you will choose this and be directed to their family terminal. Read through all of it and then talk to him again. If you did do the "I know you're a vampire" speech check, then "Now That I have a better understanding of the family..." one will be present for you to select.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112358568/222067463-58ff0716-70ed-4175-8db3-5503af6d5070.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112358568/222067709-1645ed96-3ef9-4ff1-a941-ef5099bae13e.png)

- Once you have convinced Vance to let you see Ian, unlock the door with the terminal password and approach him

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112358568/222067879-53a8a34c-7f63-41da-9ec3-fcb100d6f8ac.png)

- Again I usually just choose the first option until the speech option "Maybe I can Help You" comes up. Choose this one and then convince Ian to Stay With the Family. When you have done so, return to Vance.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112358568/222068169-754de592-8519-406e-9ea7-b2e8bee1de0a.png)

- When you begin talking to Vance again, discuss the fate of Arefu. **THE NEXT STEP IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND YOU MUST FOLLOW THIS OR YOU WILL NOT GET THE PERK**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112358568/222068493-bbbcb361-5a47-4da5-9249-d556d7f8201a.png)

- Propose (Either with 30 or 50 Medicine check) that Arefu Donates Bloodpacks and that they leave the town alone. In addition inform Vance of Ian staying with the family. Begin your travels back to Arefu when this is done

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112358568/222068633-5114c0f8-7d82-4eb8-a640-ee9f1b278c8d.png)

### **Finishing the Quest**

- Travel back to Arefu and talk to Evan King one more time. Tell him that the Family will no longer bother them and lie that Evan was not with the family

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112358568/222069114-fbc52cc8-4d3e-4bd0-a214-0c6abfe2ce1c.png)

- The above will complete the quest, but before you end your conversation with Evan, make sure to give the proposal to him from Vance. After doing so, travel to Mereseti to meet with Vance one more time

### **Becoming a Vampire**

{: .warning}
> If you are having any doubts or changes of heart, understand that once you ask Vance to "Teach Me the Ways of the Vampire" your character will permanently be a vampire. There is no "Are You Sure". You simply initiate the dialogue and you are a vampire.

- When you make it back to the Family's Hideout, talk to Vance again and ask him to "Teach the Ways of the Vampire". He will go through a short span of dialogue and then reward you the traits "Hematophage" & "Wasteland Vampire"

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112358568/222069763-444173c1-437d-4a40-9d40-8e63bdc4134e.png)

- Congratulations, you are now one of The Family, but most importantly your are a deadly nightstalker of the wastelands. You now prey on the blood of the innocent, brahmin included and hate the smell of garlic!
