The goal of this enemy tuning is to keep combat challenging for longer, challenging players to consider their equipment, spells, and class features with more critical thinking than vanilla BG3. Bosses are especially enhanced, with many assigned direct manual tweaks to provide them with new abilities and sources of danger. CX decisions are made on the assumption that players will honor Listonomicon\u2019s recommendation to keep their party size between 4 and 6 characters, and play on the custom difficulty settings described at the bottom of the List install instructions (mostly tactician, with harder shopping and more food required for Long Rest), as well as explore all of the options they now have such as enhanced access to feats, new magic items for sale or found in the world, etc. Some of the new spells given to enemies can be quite nasty, but the most debilitating ones (like turn to stone, or AoE banish effects) should be limited to boss encounters like Nere and Balthazar.

This can lead to unexpected, huge spikes of damage from enemy casters, especially in the early game. Focus fire on enemy mages!

It\u2019s also easier to juggle inventories around, compare stats, and other activities when you can add and remove a larger number of party members. However, even one extra party member is another action, bonus action, multiple gear slots, another opportunity to roll high on initiative, more healing or offensive spells, etc, added to your party\u2019s power in encounters. The game gets exponentially easier as the party size increases, and Combat Extender, Honour Mode, and other mods and game features can only do so much to counteract this phenomenon.\nTo this end, Listonomicon is recommended to play with 5 characters in the party. 3 or 4 for a challenge, 6 to make it easier. But it is up to you (and changing the party size in the mod configuration menu) to figure out how many (or how few) heroes is fun \u2013 and what your PC can handle. For example, my PC can survive most of the game with 6 heroes, but two necromancers who also summon four familiars and a beholderkin each leads to many CTDs. YMMV.
