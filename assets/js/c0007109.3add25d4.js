One of these mistakes was releasing poorly made content unfit for play and not thoroughly tested. This is a mistake I said I wouldn't make after the long process of Capital Punishment leading into Forlorn Hope, but I have made it again through creating Dungeons & Daedra. I have taken shortcuts in both iterations of its release, not taking the proper time to learn how to mod Oblivion or learn the tools and skillsets needed to properly release a good product. I would like to apologize for this. This all being said, I will be taking down Dungeons & Daedra while we complete Capital Punishment. Sometime between or shortly after 1.5-1.6, I will begin building Dungeons & Daedra yet again from the ground up, taking the time to properly learn the tools needed to produce a good list. This is not the end of Dungeons & Daedra by far, but it is definitely a newer beginning I am really looking forward to. While I work on Capital Punishment, I will try to self identify with these mistakes more frequently and strive to correct them before it has any effect on you all who take your time to download and playtest what we put out.
