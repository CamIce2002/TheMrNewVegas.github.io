This doesn\'t mean we will change our minds and create an entirely new Fallout 4 list, but for the time being we have decided against moving forward with Forlorn Hope itself.

If updating from an existing save, some funkiness from weather is possible so it\'s recommended before updating to first get to an interior location and save.
