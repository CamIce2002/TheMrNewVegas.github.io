Regular enemies will receive a bonus to their stats, rolls, movement, damage, and resources at a slower pace. Essentially, every time the player would reach a new power tier (earning a feat, extra attack, or new spell level), enemies will receive a small bonus one or two levels later. The goal of this enemy tuning is to keep combat challenging for longer, while still allowing players to enjoy the power fantasy of leveling and eventually outpacing non-boss enemies/encounters. Bosses, however, will receive their incremental bonuses to roughly keep parity with players (or slightly exceed them!). Scaling decisions are made on the assumption that players will honor Listonomicon\u2019s recommendation to keep their party size to 6 and play on Tactician Difficulty, as well as explore all of the options they now have (upgrading magic weapons, new items for sale at vendors throughout all 3 acts, rewards from new fights, etc).

These are the largest areas of concern for balancing challenge with fun. Enemies who simply can\u2019t be hit without a crit, or a constant treadmill of enemies with too much HP, is a slog. Combat should be surprising and challenging, not slow and tedious. The one known flaw in how mods implement balance tweaks to Listonomicon is the manner in which NPCs are given extra damage. Split attacks, such as magic missile and ray of fire, will add this extra damage to each attack, much like the Agonizing Blast +cha damage bonus is added to each beam of Eldritch Blast. This can lead to unexpected, huge spikes of damage from enemy casters, especially in the early game.

While Listonomicon can try to balance combat difficulty around 6 heroes, anything more than that is silly beyond reason.\nDialogue/cutscenes break more frequently as party count goes above 5.
