Across the board this is due to increases to HP and stats. In Act 2 and 3, enemies gain equivalent class features and feats similar to the choices players would make. e.g. enemy rogues gain better sneak attacks, take the Deadly Alacrity feat, etc. Generally, this is considered sufficient to keep Grymforge, Act "1.5" (the Creche), and Act 2 (Shadowcursed Lands) challenging. Act 3, however, is difficult to balance for a number of reasons. First, the vanilla game was designed for players to stop at Level 12 with a party size of 4, so late game content was never designed to be a challenge to level 16+ heroes in a group of 6. Second, the vanilla game was not designed for the sheer variety of options and synergy in classes, subclasses, feats, abilities, magic items, JWL trinkets, etc available to players by the time they reach the Lower City. Third, Listonomicon has to strike a balance that offers a fun and fair challenge to veteran players without making Act 3 an impossible jump in difficulty for anyone who did not optimize Act 1 and Act 2. Fourth, there is a general experienced Dungeon Master design philosophy that says sometimes you should just let players enjoy the power fantasy if they have earned it - while you need to throw dragons and eldritch horrors to challenge high level adventurers, you should also throw an army of mooks every now-and-then that players are able to kill with a single upcasted fireball. Fifth, Act 3 has a handful of fights where the challenge is ',(0,n.jsx)(a.em,{children:"not"})," the threat enemies pose to the player; the challenge is a time limit, or the threat to bystanders and NPCs, or other ways to challenge the player. An example scenario if this fifth point is forgotten: Rescuing Volo in Act 3. If the enemies in that fight were designed to be an appropriate challenge to level 20 adventurers, it is extremely likely that they would simply kill Volo on their first turn before the player even has a chance to react. That would not be a fun challenge, that would be a frustrating save scum situation. If Volo was made more powerful to compensate for extra dangerous enemies, then rescuing him loses the drama/risk. Listonomicon does not want to escalate an arms race of balancing friendly vs enemy NPCs vs the player if the point of the fight is not the challenge of the enemy NPCs. The sixth challenge is that simply throwing more encounters at players by filling every square inch of the map with something to fight has a bigger negative effect on the pace of the game than anything. It is important to preserve at least some of BG3's pace switching between combat, exploration, and roleplaying.
