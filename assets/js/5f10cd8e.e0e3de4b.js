So far, we\u2019ve even been able to preserve multiplayer - though many vanilla bugs are exaggerated in Listo.\nThe road into the early game is smoothed out, but the challenge of late Act One and Act Two is stretched to hopefully last longer.

True cthonauts of Larian and Script Extender code: We thank you, and everyone who contributes their time and talent to the gaming community for free. Zehtuka in particular was a big help in configuring and tweaking Combat Extender for Listonomicon, and learning better practices in mod config management in general. We ask anyone who enjoys Listonomicon to, at a minimum, use MO2\u2019s endorsement features to show their appreciation to mod makers. We appreciate everyone involved in bringing new content to the game, as well as the facilitators of patches, community frameworks, script extenders, native mod loaders, and the hundred other things that are never seen in game but make the magic happen.
