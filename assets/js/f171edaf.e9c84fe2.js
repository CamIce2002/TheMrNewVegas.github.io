You are encouraged to long rest more frequently, especially after increasing in level, so that shopkeeper inventories will refresh and fill with new content / their inventory will update to include items appropriate for your level (a good reason to use the 1000+ food units you collect by the end of Act 1). In general, you should feel encouraged to change your equipment more frequently than the base game, with fewer best in slot choices and with fewer magic items that feel like nothing but Gale food.
