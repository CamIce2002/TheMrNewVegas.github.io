If updating from an existing save, some funkiness from weather is possible so it's recommended before updating to first get to an interior location and save. Smart Training will also have to be activated but can only be activated on a save where training has not been performed at that level. The MCM recorder has also been updated to account for this so new saves won't have to worry about that, and time flies has been toned down."})]})}function c(e={}){const{wrapper:a}={...(0,o.a)(),...e.components};return a?(0,n.jsx)(a,{...e,children:(0,n.jsx)(h,{...e})}):h(e)}},1151:(e,a,t)=>{t.d(a,{Z:()=>r,a:()=>i});var n=t(7294);const o={},s=n.createContext(o);function i(e){const a=n.useContext(s);return n.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(a):{...a,...e}}),[a,e])}function r(e){let a;return a=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(o):e.components||o:i(e.components),n.createElement(s.Provider,{value:a},e.children)}}}]);
