This also allows for potential use of other Fallout: New Vegas copies to install Capital Punishment (Ex: GOG)."},{"id":"cappun1532","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/cappun1532","source":"@site/blog/2023-11-30-cappun1532/index.md","title":"Capital Punishment - 1.5.3.2 Release","description":"Release Notes","date":"2023-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 30, 2023","tags":[{"label":"Capital Punishment","permalink":"/blog/tags/capital-punishment"},{"label":"Update","permalink":"/blog/tags/update"}],"readingTime":0.195,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"TheMrNewVegas","title":"Project Lead","url":"https://www.patreon.com/Themrnewvegas","imageURL":"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112358568/223336503-5c2b0a35-ef85-4505-a47a-1d8763a514db.png","key":"mnv"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"cappun1532","title":"Capital Punishment - 1.5.3.2 Release","authors":["mnv"],"tags":["Capital Punishment","Update"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"New Subreddit & Capital Punishment 1.5.3.0 Update","permalink":"/blog/cap1530"},"nextItem":{"title":"HOS 0.9.1 Release","permalink":"/blog/hos091"}},"content":"**[Release Notes](https://www.modlists.net/docs/2capitalpunishment/Release-Notes)**\\n**Save Safe - Yes (1.5.3.0+)**\\n\\nThis is a good sized hotfix, as it both updated the LOD\'s and fixed them.

If updating from an existing save, some funkiness from weather is possible so it\'s recommended before updating to first get to an interior location and save. Smart Training will also have to be activated but can only be activated on a save where training has not been performed at that level.
