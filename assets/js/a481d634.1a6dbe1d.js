Been a bit since our last update and wanted to get out some minor fixes/additions asap to everyone :). The biggest fix was getting the desert ranger and ranger armors back to being visible, but other minor fixes have been made as well. In addition to this, the start of the game has been changed. Now, instead of leaving the vault, looting the corpses outside to get your starting gear, and moving from there, you will be given less gear. The tradeoff to this is that the gear will be more specific to your chosen tag skills and higher stats. In addition, you will now be given the option upon leaving the Vault to start your adventure in several different areas of the map. This allows the chance to start somewhere you haven't in the past and maybe begin a playthrough much different than you have before! If you're interested in a full list of additions, removals, updates, etc please check the release notes above. As always, thank you guys for continuing to play Capital Punishment, your bug reports, and I hope your holidays and breaks have been great!"})]})}function c(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,s.a)(),...e.components};return t?(0,a.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,a.jsx)(h,{...e})}):h(e)}},1151:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{Z:()=>i,a:()=>r});var a=n(7294);const s={},o=a.createContext(s);function r(e){const t=a.useContext(o);return a.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}}),[t,e])}function i(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(s):e.components||s:r(e.components),a.createElement(o.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}}}]);
