Options include Agonizing Blast, which turns Eldritch Blast into the most consistent source of DPS available in the game. They also choose a pact feature, of which Pact of the Blade is a choice. This allows you to transform any 1 melee weapon into a Pact Weapon, which retains its own stats except that it uses your Charisma to attack, and you are always considered proficient.

Battlesmiths use their Intelligence when attacking with any magical weapon (melee or ranged). They do not gain universal proficiency like a Pact Weapon, but otherwise any magical weapon they are proficient in becomes deadly. Artificers can therefor focus on maximizing Intelligence, while dumping Strength and Dexterity, and still be reliable in combat. This provides great synergy with Eldritch Knight or Psionic Fighters, all Wizards, and the Mystic class, as it combines your weapon attacks and your spellcasting under one stat. Artificers are also the only class natively proficient in firearms, and can use their artificing powers to transform a musket into a double-shot weapon that deals 1d12+ force damage. This also turns it into a magical weapon, using Intelligence instead of Dexterity. This will synergize with anything that makes ranged combat better, such as the Sharpshooter feat, or archery fighting style. An Artificer 3 could pivot into Rogue, and would have two attacks a round with their magic musket, giving two opportunities to trigger a sneak attack. An Artificer Battlesmith could pivot into Ranger, and succeed in two-weapon fighting and ranged combat, using Intelligence for both."})]})}function c(e={}){const{wrapper:a}={...(0,n.a)(),...e.components};return a?(0,t.jsx)(a,{...e,children:(0,t.jsx)(h,{...e})}):h(e)}},1151:(e,a,s)=>{s.d(a,{Z:()=>o,a:()=>r});var t=s(7294);const n={},i=t.createContext(n);function r(e){const a=t.useContext(i);return t.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(a):{...a,...e}}),[a,e])}function o(e){let a;return a=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(n):e.components||n:r(e.components),t.createElement(i.Provider,{value:a},e.children)}}}]);
