Fourth, there is a general experienced Dungeon Master design philosophy that says sometimes you should just let players enjoy the power fantasy if they have earned it. While dragons and eldritch horrors are necessary to challenge high level adventurers, such extreme encounters should be balanced out by throwing an occassional army of mooks every now-and-then that players are able to kill with a single upcasted fireball. This is important to provide the context to compare where the party started (level 3 struggling to survive on the beach) to where it is (powerful heroes/villains of the realm). The fifth challenge is that simply throwing more encounters at players by filling every square inch of the map with something to fight has a bigger negative effect on the pace of the game than anything.

That would not be a fun challenge, that would be a frustrating save scum situation. If Volo was made more powerful to compensate for extra dangerous enemies, then rescuing him loses the drama/risk.

This mod ",(0,n.jsx)(t.em,{children:"randomly"})," assigns buffs, changes, and abilities to enemies (with some logic built in to avoid giving out the most powerful effects until the party reaches higher levels).

It is recommended that you still use Listo's customized custom difficulty settings, but turn trader prices down to x3.5 and reduce the camp supply cost to long rest to whatever you prefer. Then, go to [listo install location]/mods/zzz_ListonomiconModSettings/SE_CONFIG. Rename** Combat Extender.json** to something else (like Combat Extender.json.backup).

The alt config will still be more challenging than vanilla through the various tweaks and changes to specific encounters throughout the game, however the global changes will be reduced. e.g. the static boost to enemy and boss health will be lower, so their HP still increases as the player's level does but the increase has a much lower minimum and maximum. Enemy boss scaling will be less aggressive (Player Level in Act 1, Player Level+1 in Act 2, Player Level+2 in Act 3), and the gap between improvement increments will be bigger.
