## NVR Installation

I would suggest trying the game out first to see how your performance fairs prior to installing this. That being said, it drastically changes the look of the entire game and is heavily recommended 

1.) Create a mod inside of the Modpack Resources separator called "NVR" by right clicking the seperator, then navigating going to All Mods>Create Empty Mod Inside

2.) To install NVR, begin by going to the [TES Reloaded Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/QgN6mR6eTK). Go to the #nightly-builds channel to find the latest NewVegasReloaded.zip file. Once downloaded, extract all of the files located in the archive folder to the NVR mod you created under the Modpack Resources separator by right clicking it and opening in explorer.

3.) Go to this link in the [#preset-share channel of the TES Reloaded discord](https://discord.com/channels/344843935123898369/1030630380455350272/1076152796514107493) and download Sigerious's preset

4.) Take this file (NewVegasRoladed.dll.config) and in your NVR mod, overwrite the same file. This should be located in NVR>NVSE>Plugins

5.) Enable the mod in MO2 & Launch the game. Should work from here :)
