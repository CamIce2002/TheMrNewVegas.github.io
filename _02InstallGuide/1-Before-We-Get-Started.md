## **READ BEFORE CONTINUING:** 
### **1.) Please do not bother the Tale of Two Wastelands Developers/Discord or Other NV related Discords with troubleshooting questions regarding this mod list. Even if you think your question pertains to the Tale of Two Wastelands installation, please ask us in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/43EhRjU).**

### **2.) You MUST follow this guide in the order given and word for word. If you do not you will experience issues. Please read through it at least once prior to install**

### **3.) This mod pack is not a vanilla experience nor is it a stability guide. In addition we are not endorsed by the Tale of Two Wastelands team. Regardless of endorsements and the prior statements, we have kept stability, gameplay balance, and cohesiveness in mind. To ensure a basis of this, I have utilized guides such as [WSG](https://wastelandsurvivalguide.com), [VNV](https://vivanewvegas.github.io/index.html), & the [TTW Installation Guide](https://thebestoftimes.github.io/index.html)**.

## **Pre-Installation Checklist**
- **At least 120GB of free space**
- **A Nexus Account**
- **A FRESH GLOBAL STEAM installation (Eastern European PCR Steam, GOG, and any Non Steam versions are not compatible) of Fallout NV GOTY and either a Steam or Epic Games installation of FO3**
> **Why does FNV Need to be Steam Global?:** This is due to Wabbajack functionality/how we have set up the way Wabbajack downloads the mod pack. This doesn't apply to FO3 as it is used only to compile Tale of Two Wastelands

- **Your Steam Library in a Non-protected directory (I do the surface of my drive)**
> **Protected libraries are Program Files, Your Desktop, Etc.([Tutorial Here](https://www.howtogeek.com/257472/how-to-painlessly-move-your-steam-library-to-another-folder-or-hard-drive/))**
- **[Directx Runtime Libraries](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8109)**

- **[Visual C++ Runtime Libraries](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170)**
- **[7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) (Or Winrar)**
- **Nexus Premium is a BIG SUGGESTION!**
- **The [Wabbajack Launcher](https://www.wabbajack.org)**

## **Starting Off...**

- **Install both Fallout New Vegas & Fallout 3. After they have installed, run them both once and then close their launchers after your settings have been detected. You may also take this time to quickly change your resolution to what you prefer for Fallout NV.**
> Make sure to enable HDR and disable V-Sync

> **Make sure old installations are completely deleted and reinstalled, especially if they have been previously modded.**

> **Make sure any pre-existing ini’s are deleted  so they game can build them again post installation. These can be found in Documents > My Games > Fallout NV most commonly**

- **Now Install [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable x86 & x64 Version](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170) – Install them over each other by clicking “repair” when you install the other version.**

### **Final Sidenote**

- **When you have finished this guide, you will have two installations of Fallout New Vegas. The one you downloaded through Steam and the one that was compiled by Wabbajack.**

> **The One Compiled by Steam will be in your typical steam directory (Commonly C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\FalloutNewVegas)**

> **The One Compiled by Wabbajack will be in the folder where wabbajack will deliver all of the files (Whatever path you choose in Wabbajack\Stock Game)**

- **YOU WILL NOT BE EDITING YOUR ORIGINAL STEAM PATH. MO2 AND THIS MODPACK WILL WORK OFF OF THE STOCK GAME FOLDER. ANY PATHS YOU SET, EDITS YOU MAKE, ETC SHOULD BE DONE TO THE STOCK GAME FOLDER GRANTED THEY ARE IN THE INSTALLATION GUIDE**
