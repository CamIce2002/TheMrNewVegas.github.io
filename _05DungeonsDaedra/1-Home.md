## **Welcome to the Dungeons & Daedra Wiki**

This is currently a limited release list which heavily relies on both the [Heartland Wabbajack Framework](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/mod-lists/blob/master/heartland/readme.md) & [Bevilex Modlist](https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/47591) on Nexus. For those familiar with these two guides, install steps and resources for troubleshooting will be relatively similar as the changes made between Heartland/D&D are minimal and (for the time being) only gameplay related. That being said a majority of credit for this list should be associated with Bevilex and the folks behind Heartland

## **What is Dungeons & Daedra?**

Dungeons & Daedra is a total graphical and gameplay overhaul of Oblivion which utilizes Bevilex's Modlist & [Maskar's Oblivion Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/42780) to create a Dungeons & Dragons like experience. While this was originally a prevalent theme in Oblivion itself, there were areas that lacked depth such as dungeon delving, enemy variability/variety, etc. This is where Maskar's Oblivion Overhaul comes into play. While not entirely lore friendly, it adds a plethora of new items, enemies, and features that replicate the feel of Dungeons & Dragons like gameplay.

## **What does "Limited Release" Mean**

This means that for the time being, the list will be released as is and will not receive updates for the forseeable future. While I would like to develop this list further past what is currently included, Oblivion is a fickle beast of a game to mod and with more additions comes a higher likelihood of the list breaking and conflicts to be had.
