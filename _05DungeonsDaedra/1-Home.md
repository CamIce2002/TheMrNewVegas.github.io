# **NOTICE**
Dungeons & Daedra is on an indefinite development hold as we completely rebuild the list from the ground up. Below is the announcement regarding why it has been taken down.

`As we have moved from True Vegas to True Vegas TTW, then finally Capital Punishment, we have slowly tried our best to improve on our past mistakes. One of these mistakes was releasing poorly made content unfit for play and not thoroughly tested. This is a mistake I said I wouldn't make after the long process of Capital Punishment leading into Forlorn Hope, but I have made it again through creating Dungeons & Daedra. I have taken shortcuts in both iterations of its release, not taking the proper time to learn how to mod Oblivion or learn the tools and skillsets needed to properly release a good product. I would like to apologize for this. This all being said, I will be taking down Dungeons & Daedra while we complete Capital Punishment. Sometime between or shortly after 1.5-1.6, I will begin building Dungeons & Daedra yet again from the ground up, taking the time to properly learn the tools needed to produce a good list. This is not the end of Dungeons & Daedra by far, but it is definitely a newer beginning I am really looking forward to. While I work on Capital Punishment, I will try to self identify with these mistakes more frequently and strive to correct them before it has any effect on you all who take your time to download and playtest what we put out. My apologies again and as always, thank you all for the support you've shown us since we started!

TLDR: Dungeons & Daedra being taken down again, will be rebuilt from the ground up between or after CapPun 1.5-1.6 as its own original list and with better knowledge surrounding the tools used for modding Oblivion`

## **Welcome to the Dungeons & Daedra Wiki**

This is a list which heavily relies on both the [Heartland Wabbajack Framework](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/mod-lists/blob/master/heartland/readme.md) & [Bevilex Modlist](https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/47591) on Nexus. For those familiar with these two guides, install steps and resources for troubleshooting will be relatively similar as the changes made between Heartland/D&D are minimal and (for the time being) only gameplay related. That being said a majority of credit for this list should be associated with Bevilex and the folks behind Heartland

## **What is Dungeons & Daedra?**

Dungeons & Daedra is a total graphical and gameplay overhaul of Oblivion which utilizes Bevilex's Modlist & [Maskar's Oblivion Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/42780) to create a Dungeons & Dragons like experience. While this was originally a prevalent theme in Oblivion itself, there were areas that lacked depth such as dungeon delving, enemy variability/variety, etc. This is where Maskar's Oblivion Overhaul comes into play. While not entirely lore friendly, it adds a plethora of new items, enemies, and features that replicate the feel of Dungeons & Dragons like gameplay.

## **A Big Thank You to the Heartland Team**
This list is a near clone of there iteration of Bevilex's guide and without this list, I doubt D&D would have been able to start with good enough footing. Thank you guys a ton and as I find more of your socials, I will post them here
