## What is Halls of Sovngarde?

Halls of Sovngarde is a requiem based list which seeks to fully overhaul most elements of Skyrim entirely. With respects to Vanilla Skyrim, many of the old and beloved features of the game we all enjoy have been kept the same. On the other hand, areas which require updating and modernization have been put under the microscope, each minute detail modified to ensure the most modern and cohesive experience possible. This is not a vanilla list, nor is it a list which seeks to completely remove the original feel Skyrim gave us 12 years ago. This list will pay homage to the things we all grew to love while improving the look and overall feel.

## Graphical Changes

With a wide variety of new textures, as well as vastly improved lighting and shaders, the world of Skyrim has been transformed to something more fitting to a modern appeal.

## New Weapons, Armor, & Clothing

A host of new weapons, armors, and clothing pieces adorn both the NPC's and fill the world. These all breathe a new life into the game, creating both diversity to NPC's and new playstyles for the player.

## New Quests, Jobs, & Adventures

Many new quest mods have been added to this pack and even vanilla quests have been modified to provide new ways of accomplishing them. Whether full fledged adventures, new occupations for you to partake in, or small additions throughout the world, countless hours of content lay ahead.

## Immersive Features

This list is not a hardcore list, however certain elements such as thirst, sleep, and hunger, as well as injuries and enhanced diseases are present to make the player have to care about their wellbeing and make choices accordingly. Skills, and even the UI have been changed to show a very clear progression as more perks are unlocked and your character grows stronger. This provides a sense of satisfaction when a challenge that was previously impossible at a lower level is conquered.

## Stability, Balance, Bug Fixes, & Performance Improvement

A large problem with Skyrim, modded or not, is that it is party to a host of issues. Without boring you all with the details, I will mention again that this list was made with resources such as Learn to Mod & the Lux discord. Further additions past that have or are currently being tested/vetted for any issues they may present in this ongoing project and at this point, many already have.

### Disclaimer to the Above: As for performance improvements, most of the testing that was done was done on a mid-end PC and performance was very manageable in most areas, with only large cities providing any issues. However, performance may very and further steps will be taken if possible to improve this.

## And Much More!

I will continue to update this page as we have much more on this list than the above already. For those interested in our full list of mods, you can see that here

### Final Note: None of this would be possible without the hard work of the many mod authors, the staff behind the Wabbajack platform, or the people who have work alongside me during development. They have all sacrificed their free time to develop and release the works associated with this list, and absolutely free of charge. Please take the time to endorse some of these authors if you can or send them some kind feedback as they are more than deserving.
